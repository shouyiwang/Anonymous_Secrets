You ever been so in love with someone that their whole world becomes your world?

Hopelessly in love, more than I have ever been. I guess this is why it hurts. Because even when I tried to get them to understand, even when they said they did…they don’t…or won’t. Is it wrong to still want a life that is mine? Is it wrong.. to want to forge my own dreams? Why the double standard? Plans we made together they go off on their own to do alone, leaving me feeling jilting… hurt. It’s fine for them, to do what they want.. to make their own plans. When I try to share my goals, my intentions, surface level they say they support me, but behind my back they tell others something differently. Feeling as though because I want to work on bettering myself that somehow deducts any love I have for them. I can be gone a day and they make me feel..so guilty. As long as they get to have fun, they can go days and even weeks without spending quality time with me and I have to be the understanding one. How is any of it fair?! Am I crazy? Am I wrong? Am I selfish? They expect all of me, to be their support, their cheerleader, their comfort to fuel their ambitions and I do so gladly. But now… I hurt. I have invested so much time into their wants and dreams and I feel mine slipping away… what do I do? And why does my heart continue to break?

Secret.create(id: 211959, content: "Should I start by saying that if you are reading this to please note if I had a Choice I would not bother you? Kindly read through. At least I will know someone listened. I am 25 years old. I don’t have much of an education, but I was very ambitious until August 2017. I was working at a casino in my city. The pay was enough to cater for my needs and I could afford a few drinks a month. I was happy, had quite life. I lived by the principle of not expecting anything from anyone or depending on anybody. But in August on I met a man who was successful, powerful, understanding and most importantly, seemed  genuinely willing to help me make something out of my life. I told him about my life’s aspirations, one of them being a farming project. A month later he offered to fund my project on the basis of trust. He gave me $2000 cash. I couldn’t believe it. I was very happy. My dream was stating to become a reality. I resigned from my casino job two weeks after, got a farmland, drew a lease agreement, and the following week I was to pay, sign, and start working on the farm. When the day came I took the cash and whatever I needed and left. I was really excited. But to my surprise, when I got there the money was missing. Up to today, I have no idea how the money got lost. I reported the incident to a local police station. But the damage was irreversible. At times when I think about it, I feel this man had a hand in it,but can’t prove it. I later learnt that he had me watched, he knew everything I did, but when I told him about the money I lost he said that I was trying to  swindle him off his money. And demanded I return every penny immediately. He said since I could not be trusted I had to sign an agreement stating the day I should pay his money back. That day has since been overdue. Having resigned the from my job, I was desperate to get another job. I finally got an offer in the neighboring country- Uganda. Since I wanted to be free from constant calls, letting me know how if he wished to ruin my life he could, the feeling of someone watching my and my family and the desperation to give him back his money, I took the offer. Fate was not done with me. The gentleman was a con. He had no job to offer. That was the first time in my life I ever contemplated suicide. Luckily, I put myself together and checked in to a cheap motel. While there, I got a friend who offered me a corner of his tiny room. That man was an angel sent from heaven. I would go out to look for minor jobs and within the year I was there- 10th Jan-Dec- I managed to clear $920. I missed my family, and so during the holidays I came back to Kenya. Ever since I have not gotten any job and have not been able to pay the rest of the money. He gave me an ultimatum, whereby I should have the money by 29 March, which is fast approching. There are people following me everywhere I go and I am constantly afraid of what will happen to me if I fail to pay. I know you are thinking, why don’t you go to the police? The reason is here in Kenya the rule of law counts for little if you are penniless like me even when you have the evidence. Whereas he can bribe any cop and get a way with it. I wished with my whole being that by today. I would be free, I have would cleared the whole amount, but I haven’t. That is why I am here to ask for your help. I am a tiny insignificant being that if I died nothing changes. But for my sister and brothers I am a flicker of hope. They look up to me. They are the ones that have stopped me from taking my own life. I want to stop being afraid, to have my privacy back, to live and hope again. This money I owe has denied me all of those things. I know you don’t know me, you don’t even have any business helping me, you have your financial needs, but still I ask you to please help me overcome this. It doesn’t matter if it’s a cent, a dollar, whatever. I will be happy. If this post makes angry, I apologize, don’t insult me because challenges in life come to everyone.

I can remember waiting at the doctor’s office the whole day, the pain I felt as I laid down on the table, the car ride home with his friend. Looking up while laying down on my own bed triggers me still. I knew he was hiding something. He was seeing his ex the whole 2 months I was pregnant. Didn’t even bother seeing me. My ex used to text me saying he was fixing his soon-to-be car with his father while he was actually down the streets heading to his ex’s place. I still remember how dark and cloudy the day was when we cut knots at what used be our favorite hangout spot. That favorite hang out spot was the same place he asked me to be his girlfriend, too. I asked him so many questions for closure but he barely answered most of them. This is my secret and my experience. My pain, and the beginning of finding my strength again. I’m 20 years old now, struggling in college, wondering why I’m still thinking about my ex while I have a boyfriend who tells me that he loves me a million times a day. Sometimes I think that because of this, I feel like I don’t deserve my boyfriend and the love.

Secret.create(id: 211901, content: "I was born in a family with two parents and a silver spoon in my mouth. All that money yet it doesn’t fucking help with my inability to feel emotions. When I was 5 years old I was forced to take medications for ADHD. Around 8 I was on at least 10 different medications. Fast forward 12 years later I decided to say fuck it and stop taking my medicine forever. The first thing I noticed is I was no longer a fucking cry baby all the time. Just the slightest shit would set me off in a blood boiling rage. The second thing I noticed was my verbal communication improved tremendously. I went from not fucking existing to being a smooth talker. Last thing I noticed very quickly is that I have no moral conscience at all or fear that I will get caught, nor do I feel any emotion at all when shit happens like when my dad had cancer. I don’t know if the fucking medication numbing me for the past 15 years had a big impact on my development or if that’s how I’ve always been but I just know now that when I hurt someone, steal, or lie (and I’m also a very good liar) I don’t feel nothing. No conscience, no guilt, no remorse or regret. I am nothing more than a hollow shell. I feel like I just wear these fucking masks every time I go talk to people, which although I’m good at it in the end it’s only about what it gets me. I obviously hate feeling like this. I know all the words but don’t hear any of the music. To me an emotion is just a word that I have understanding of what it looks like, but know understanding of how it feels. For me the damage is done but for any of you fucking sick fuck white people that live in big houses in the suburbs reading this I just want you to know that all this pills that you are giving to your children to keep them critically sedated is in no way shape or form sustainable in the long run. Eventually something inside them will snap they will just end up with sociopathic tenancies like me. The only difference between me and guys who get caught is I have self-preservation and they obviously do not.

A good deed, followed by further good deeds…. I’ve contemplated this plenty of times and one act of mine has had me he today reflecting on something i did 17 years ago.. Back then I was in the army, in great physical condition and full of arrogance and bravado.  On holidays back to Brisbane where I was from prior to enlisting.  It was a Monday or Tuesday night, a night where finding a partner in crime for the night would prove hard and everyone typically stays in those nights, receiving from the weekend and preparing for the remainder of their working week.  However this didn’t apply to me, on holidays everyday is a Saturday night and any activity could prove to be an exciting adventure. The Treasury Casino was the destination, open 24hrs with drinking and gambling would be suitable for a solo journey.  Hours of time in there results in intoxication and loss of money, though i wasn’t concerned at the time i just wanted more excitement and felt that this place running on empty.  I had a fire cracker on me at the time, a few friends of mine had been fooling around with them a day or so earlier and i found myself  with one on hand while I was there.  At that moment of realising that I had the cracker and being in a less that sound state I began to consider letting it off.  I knew that the fuse would provide 3-4 seconds head start and providing i didn’t look suspicious i would have a further few seconds to make my get away.  I positioned myself close to exit and lit the fuse and dropped it o the ground,  began my brisk walk to the door and heard an almighty bang.  the enclosed room amplified the sound and the people whom i could see we rather shocked and had that typically flinch that occurs when frightened.  As I got to the door, head down and full or adrenaline i turned for a split second to see was was unfolding behind me.  A security guard/ doorman had seen me and had an instinct to have me.  He wasn’t the typically mall type guard whom was mature aged and in less than good condition.  This guy was quite muscular and wore a look of determination to get me, a look that left me in no doubt that if he caught me I would be in trouble!  I ran like the wind, the thrill/ nervousness was like a power boost that had me off and gone into the distance with the sound of cars around me drowned out by the sound of me beating heart. Once back at my car, yes I didn’t mentioned I drove into the city.  the first poor decision of the night and followed up again when getting back to the car after consuming enough alcohol to well and truly exceed the legal driving limit.  Not deterred I turned the key and off I went, unsure of what was to be next off I went.  Late/ early morning at this point and my first though was to get laid, and nearby a place called Fortitude Valley was the place to meet the type of girls that hang out on the street (if you know what I mean).  Driving along the street I saw some girls and decided to stop and chat with a girl who looked similar age to me and wouldn’t describe as unattractive.  After I brief conversation and verbal contract I guess you could say she got in and off we went. Not long after getting in the car I asked her where her place was, she said that she didn’t have one and that we would do the deed in the car.  Shocked, excited and up for it I just asked where that spot should be and she directed me to the top of a hill.  Quiet suburban street with plenty of trees and dim lid street lights.  We both got into the back seat and removed our clothes, getting into the act.  The back seat proved more than difficult to move in and I found myself out side the car, standing naked at the rear door and her all fours on the seat as I pounded away.  The narrowness on the seat, the arch of the door frame, the door itself all made things awkward and finally I suggested her get out and lean over the rear boot.  At this time all she had on was a sports tyre bra and Im still naked.  This was a much better position and thus I get right into it and climax. At this point I walk around to the drivers side of the car and get in, waiting for her I am looking back in the mirror and puzzled at why she is taking so long and what it is she is doing.  Milliseconds seem to feel like minutes and at that point I decided to commence driving.  I look back in the mirror and can see her frantically running towards the car.  Even twice tapping the rear boot trying to keep up, 400 meters down the road I stopped to throw her back out of the car after taking back my money, then headed home for the night.   The next day to find all of her clothes still in the foot hold of the passenger seat. Its a crazy story i know and completely true, truly I feel guilt about my actions and a small piece of me laughs and thinks the immature behaviour has the excuse of being a harmless joke.  I tell the story on occasions to friends (obviously only guys!) and I consistently get a even split result of incredibly horrified and blatant laugher.  I always being the story with, “tell me? and I going to hell? I do think about the girl often and if I had my time again I wouldn’t do it! Can I ask you guys? Am I going to hell???

She laid down next to me and started rubbing my shoulders so we could both relax a bit. I closed my eyes as she began moving her hands down a bit towards my abdomen. Suddenly I felt her nails glide over my stomach, causing me to gasp. She didn’t know I was ticklish. I could barely see her smirk in the dark as I felt one of her nails poke my ribs and her digits started dancing all over my stomach. I couldn’t help laughing. She had me down for a good eight or so minutes before it stopped and there was silence for a minute. Then I felt her move down towards my shorts and push her warm, soft hand inside. Then I felt her start doing the same thing she did on my stomach, but this time on my penis. It felt ticklish but so so good. It didn’t take long for me to get hard. She’d go fast and then slow and then stop for a few seconds, and then fast and faster and slow. I never knew. I felt her soft whispers in my ear. “You like that don’t you baby” and “does it feel good?” After a good twenty minutes of her massaging it and stroking with featherlight touches, teasing and tickling, I felt her adjust her position I then felt my shorts get pulled down all the way. I thought she’d just keep rubbing it, but suddenly I started feeling kisses along the shaft. My breath hitched at the first, unexpected kiss. Any man knows that kisses are the worst type of teasing. After a while of just her kissing all over, I felt her start sucking and licking. It felt so good, and I hadn’t masturbated or had sex in about two months, so it was a lot to take. She’d lick up and down and then kiss the head. She whispered “i’m gonna make you feel so good” just before beginning to suck rapidly on the head while using one hand to tickle my balls and the other to rapidly rub and stroke up and down my entire shaft. I couldn’t take it, and I began moaning a lot. With every moan, it seemed to feel so much better. I felt so weak at her expertise. Just before I orgasmed, she felt my pulsing and stopped all at once. The near orgasm seemed to settle down, and then she went back at it. She keot teasing me for almost an hour. The torture was unbearable, yet it was the most amazing torture of my life. After two hours, she finally let me orgasm and she swallowed. We fell asleep not long after.", category: "a wild experience", likes:  1, dislikes:  0)

I’m no virgin but I hadn’t ever had a hand job before, and this felt like pure heaven. Also a couple friends were next to us, but it was too dark to see, so I spent the entire movie (that’s how long she had me!) Trying not to squirm while biting my lip. It took all I had not to start moaning. I’m glad we were sitting cuz my knees were so fucking weak. After the first 10-ish minutes I jizzed my shorts, and she knew it, but she still kept going, smirking lightly as I twitched and tried to keep my breath steady. Her hand was so soft and I went nuts when she’d occasionally glide her long false nails over the shaft and head. When the movie started coming to an end, she began to rapidly tickle it using ONLY her fingernails and going faster than she had the entire time. The fact that she was full on looking at me grinning by then just made it even more torture. Then she wrapped her whole hand around me and rubbed up and down quickly for the next 5-ish minutes until the credits. The credits ended and then lights turned on RIGHT before I orgasmed again. She had to stand up and leave me like that or else we would have gotten caught. Honestly, it’s so much more fun when you have to hold everything back. Best thing that’s happened to me.

She told me for round two she wasn’t holding anything back and OH my GOD….. I have never ejaculated that hard in my life. Now don’t get me wrong our life doesn’t revolve around sex but I think now it will be more integrated into our life. she doesn’t know this but one day I am going to marry her.", category: "a truth", likes:  2, dislikes:  0)

I’m male, 18 years old, and…let’s face it…a nerd, a skinny, pathetic, glasses wearing, socially awkward nerd.  But after HE texts me and tells me to be ready…all that falls away.  Then I only serve one purpose. So I take a shower, douche as he taught me, leave my window unlocked, and I wait.  It’s the middle of the night when he visits, always. I’m told to wait face down with my legs spread, so I do. My ass involuntarily starts to hump when I hear you sneaking in.  My asshole is palpitating while I listen to you undress.  You do it in silence, as always.  The bed moves as you crawl onto it from behind me – you’re a large man, and I’m intimidated and turned on by your size.  You roll my asscheeks with your hands and I hear you sighing..I moan, too, when you spread my cheeks wide. I bury my head in the pillow while you bury you face between my cheeks.  Your beard drives me nuts and I don’t want to get too loud. I love the rude sounds of your feasting – the wet licking sounds, the sucking sounds while you devour my asshole.  I love this and know you do also.  You’ve been doing this for four years so know all my buttons.  I hump backwards against your face while your tongue works its way deeper into my ass and getting it sloppy. I’m in heaven when you drag your large body against my back, burying your bearded face against the side of my neck and hump me.  Your hairy body settles against mine, and I feel your thick cock humping my asscrack.  The anticipation is driving me insane. Finally you reach down and drag your fat dick down my crack and park it at the hole.  Part of me wants you to shove it in entirely with one strong stroke.  You only do that when you know we’re alone in the house, though…tonight my mom and dad are in their room downstairs so you hump it into me a little at a time,  opening my asshole as you go.  It seems to take forever, as always, for your bush to finally settle at my hole, your thick meat finally balls deep inside me. You start to fuck, dragging your cock out until just the head is held into my hole by my twitching sphincter.  You drive it back in, only to drag it out again slowly.  It’s maddening – these slow gentle fucks.  I feel my own cock throbbing underneath me, leaking precum onto the sheets my mom just washed and replaced this afternoon – at my request. Your own precum has joined your spit now and I’m very wet…I open a lot easier and a lot faster now and you pick up the pace, and pulling your cock out of me completely before shoving it back into me.  I feel the familiar pressure as your veiny cock massages my prostate – your cock is so thick it’s impossible not to hit it.  I begin to meet your strokes halfway, grinding my ass against your pubes when we connect. I whimper as I start to cum uncontrollably and you bury yourself deep.  My wet asshole clenches and relaxes around your cock and you bite on my neck while my cock spurts cum onto the sheets beneath me.  Then your cock thickens as I calm down…and I feel you begin to spurt also, filling my hole with your thick white cum. We lay in silence, you collapsed on top of me, while your cock softens and finally slips out.  After you recover, I feel your weight leave me.  I listen in silence as you dress and slip out of my window and return to your own home next door. I wonder when you’ll text me again as I slip off into sleep.", category: "a truth", likes:  5, dislikes:  0)

Her autism is pretty obvious and when we are out together people sometimes treat her kind of shitty and I don’t tolerate that, my friends feel uncomfortable around her because she acts kind of odd sometimes and she talks about anything she is thinking of and she talks to strangers all the time. I tell my friends not to treat her differently and to treat her the same way they treat me.

I didn’t tell them that my friends were already waiting for me and I need to hurry. (My friends fetched me, I forgot to tell my family that too).

He said I won’t be able to enter college without him… and said I was an ungrateful daughter… and few hurting words too, such as “Who do you think you are? You are nothing without me. Just because you enter the college, you are so proud of yourself now?” Infront of everybody inside the car. I can’t believe he would say that. He totally embarrassed me. Everyone was looking at me because they don’t know whats going on. I didn’t say anything. Just my tears streaming down my face non-stop. My dad always has problem with his temper, and an alcoholic since I was a kid. The scolding went on and on until I dropped somewhere and took a bus. inside the bus, I was crying too.

She’s shorter than me, I’m 5’6 so when with each other, I’m looking down at her. She’s the finest white girl I know. She’s not skinny or too big, she’s perfect. Her personality is perfect, sexy but still serious when needed. Her physical features are near perfect. Her boobs are busty, so I do notice them a lot. Her ass leaves me speachless…it’s not huge but her thighs are big and it fits perfectly. Her lips are filled and add to how beautiful she is. She constantly wears black leggings, so you can’t blame me if I look. Of course I sneak some pictures, but never physical, I know my limits. I’ve pleasured myself to her countless times, thinking about her lips around my pulsating cock. I’ve dreamed of eating her out and letting her cum fill my mouth. Constantly thinking about her big ass riding my dick as I kiss her neck while she Screams in my ear. I’ve dreamed of her riding me until climax, only for her to get off and swallow every drop of cum that my cock drips.

COHEN COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND REFORM U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FEBRUARY 27, 2019 Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today. I have asked this Committee to ensure that my family be protected from Presidential threats, and that the Committee be sensitive to the questions pertaining to ongoing investigations. Thank you for your help and for your understanding. I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee’s questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump. One of the things i know is that… In 2004, a little boy named Jimmy was sleeping in his bed. He then woke up and walked in front of his laundry room and spotted a glass antique doll with blond hair on the laundry room window ledge. He glared at the doll and screamed, “Whore! Slut! The sandwich that never knew bread!” Jimmy immediately regretted his decision as the doll glared at him and jumped off the window ledge. Jimmy ran outside faster than he thought possible and shut the front door behind him, leaving the doll trapped in the living room. However, once he ran off of his porch, his clothing vanished and he was sucked ass-first into the sky at the speed of light. Once he reached space, his naked ass crashed through the floor in his living room. His ass was sticking out of the floor in his living room whilst the rest of his body was trapped underneath his house. He couldn’t even move a single cheek! Then, his vision somehow transported into his living room, and he became a mere perspective. It was as if he was looking at himself through a security camera. He saw the doll slowly approach his ass, put its head on his asshole, and then scream, “Your scourning parading, matched! No more truly will away!” Immediately afterwards, the doll let loose a high-pitched screech that sounded like the scream of a little girl. This act inflicted extreme amounts of tickle upon Jimmy’s ass! Now that you have read even a single word of this, the same glass antique doll will suck you up into space, crash your ass into the living room, and inflict extreme amounts of tickle upon your ass! To avoid this, post this whole post on 3 different websites, or there will be no truly will away for you!

Deze bes sleppun in a well tanite. 2 differunt wellz deze nevuh be togethuh. Poor jimmy ran as fast as he could before he met the were pals. Dancing out one by one they said!! I am a were donkey. I transform into one on the full moon but it’s a little hard to walk straight with this big floppy donkey dick getting in the way. I usually jack off on people’s lawns and mail boxes I am an black woman with a deep dark secret. I’m actually a were-panther. When I transform I look like a humanoid panther with a huge bouncing black ass just like in human form. I’m in heat tonight so I think there’s going to be a gang bang in the woods with the local werewolves. 22 yr old female here with a weird problem I wouldn’t admit to anybody irl. So I woke up last night in some kind of adrenaline shock. It was like my whole body just reacted and catapulted me out of bed. I transformed into a werewolf on the spot and my pussy became wetter and more furious than any tropical storm. I ran all the way to my crush’s house and hit the door ass first. I started twerking straight through it and then shoved my werewolf pussy in his face with the door frame still lodged around my wide birthing hips. We must have fucked for ten hours straight. Is all this normal? I want to become a werewolf and fight for dominance with another one, eventually losing and getting raped by him. Corvallus is live and well at the OIA. I was dominated by a giant alpha male werewolf last night. He jumped out of the woods and stuck his giant fifteen inch angrily erect cock directly in my face. I had to back down because of how big and powerful he was. He let me live in exchange for sucking his giant member. I got a lifetime supply of protein in one night. Come by and you can get one to!! Same here mate!!! Imagine being a werewolf. A perfect marriage of strength and primal rage. None of the lies society has built in, just an honest, hedonistic and powerful creature, oozing with sexual potency. Think about not having to be human ever again. Your body contorts and stretches as your bones and muscles expand, your fangs grow painfully, and when you’ve made the change, you are a pure beast, with your sharp teeth and glistening cock in the moonlight. Raw power and rippling muscles. Hunt whatever you want to and fuck whenever you want to. Sharp claws to tear through anything in your way and a massive dick to keep your hunger satisfied I want to screw a woman or a man while I transform into a werewolf as we listen to Amon Amarth’s album “Once Sent From the Golden Hall” in its entirety When I was thirteen, I legitimately thought that I was a werewolf. I feel only mortification and resentment towards that dark time of my life. I hate my thirteen year old self so much that when I found the diary that I kept at that time, I shredded it and then burned it, all the while cursing myself and the ludicrous impression I left of myself to others. It’s been two years, and I cant look at the people I’ve told in the eyes anymore without getting flashbacks that get me into a self-wasting rage. What’s weird is that I still like the idea of a werewolf, and I LARP and roleplay with werewolf characters, but that doesn’t upset me at all. It’s just the knowledge that I actually thought that at midnight on my fourteenth birthday, I would turn into a wolfish humanoid, and the fact that I told several people that I was a werewolf, that makes me want to tear out my hair. I love the idea of a sexy creature like a symbiote encasing me in goo. I also love the idea of transforming into a large, muscular werewolf and then getting encased in goo… So I (Female, 12 yrs. old), went into my principles office. He appeared to be very happy and charming at first but when we got into his office he said, “Susanne, we need to talk about something”. Then, I said, “Alright. Let’s talk”. After I said this, he sort of frowned at his computer screen and said “hold up a minute”. He got up and walked out of the office and said WHAT IN THE? Thats when I heard the screaming. It was absolutely horrifying. This man in a bear suit was running around screaming Hi kids! I’m Pedobear! The Pedestrian bear! See me walk? I’m a Running Bear!! I’M-MARCHING-DETERMINED!!!! (He said this in rapid pace, like a. lolipop cheerleading squad) WHHHHHHEEEERRRRREEEEE AM I GOING? TO-YOUR-SCHOOL-RIGHT-NOW!!!!! YAY PEDY-BEAR!!!!! He was in a white dress and he was holding it in his outstretched arms. You could see bombs and there was a turban on his head. He had a isis flag draped over his shoulders and bin laden approves was written on his shirt. He ran right at me and there was a bulge in his pants that was quickly forming. But then he saw this retard and ran at him screaming NNNNAAAAGGGGGGGGGEEEERRRRRR!!! And he blew himself up. This happened in the morning. Its almost dinner now where I am and he had a dark web site where he said he was going to Get 72 Lolis, Inshallah. And he pledged himself to Allah. I wish I was one of them.

Secret.create(id: 210832, content: "So I really screwed up. I sure enough did. I took you for granted and I thought that there was something more than what there was. You promised me we would do this one thing together and today you told me no. My heart broke. You thought way too far deep into what I said and caused a massive wall to be built instantaneously between us. I have poured my heart out to you, I have told you so many things that I would and could not ever tell anyone else. I trusted you, I confided in you and now I believe I shouldn’t have told you one damn thing. I’m such a fricken fool! Sure, you said things to me too but I never used them against you. In some sort of odd way I really do think you used all the things I told you, nearly all my secrets, against me. I didn’t ever think you could be so low as to do that. Ever. You acted so petty. I am not without shame but neither are you. To lead me on and not tell me what you honestly and really wanted was wrong. Maybe you should have said something to me weeks ago and not until we had a flare up today. There has been weeks in between your current life and when you and I planned what we were going to do together. You KNOW just how much time and money I had invested into this plan of ours and to rectify you say you will just pay me back the money I used. What the hell is that? You could pay me back ten fold but that does not and will not cover the back stabbing act you pulled today. Can I trust you anymore. NO WAY! Will I ever EVER share ANYTHING with you personal again? NOT A CHANCE! So now you will feel the wrath that others know. You will be the one that has fallen out of my good graces and know what it’s like to have an unconditional love taken away. Pleasantries, smiles and how-do-you-dos will still be around but none of them heartfelt. I will not go out of my way to ask how you’re doing, ask about any issues we have ever talked about that concerns you, ask about your well being nor ever talk about anything we have ever talked about in the past. You will not ever know just how much you hurt me. I will not give you the satisfaction nor the opportunity to ever know. Maybe later in life you will know what it’s like to lose such a good person in your life because I obviously was not that person, but when they do come around and they use you, like you did me, I hope you feel that pain you have given me times the heat of a thousand suns. To take someones heart and pound it on the ground is not only egotistical but shows just what sort of character you possess. If anyone that knows you could only know just how awful you can be when you only see what’s good for you at the moment. You have broke this person and it will take so much time to heal. Thank you for having me crawl back into my hole that I called home for all these years, thank you for making me realize that once again I can trust no one. All this because you wouldn’t tell me where anything stood BEFORE I progressed with MY time. You said you appreciate people taking time out for you, well what the hell was I doing then? OH YEA! I was WASTING MY TIME WITH YOU and you ate it up like candy all the while laughing at me, seeing just how far you could take me. I can not BELIEVE you did this. I can not BELIEVE you are actually a punk ass and I thought of you differently. You actually suck! I once told you that you were the best person to come into my life for a long time, now I know you were the absolute WORST one to ever cross my path, and the sad thing about all of this, if anyone does come around that is really sincere or really cares, someone that REALLY wants to be part of my life, I won’t ever know and that would be because of you…. you piece of SHI*!", category: "a truth", likes:  2, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 210796, content: "TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL D. COHEN COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND REFORM U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES FEBRUARY 27, 2019 Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me here today. I have asked this Committee to ensure that my family be protected from Presidential threats, and that the Committee be sensitive to the questions pertaining to ongoing investigations. Thank you for your help and for your understanding. I am here under oath to correct the record, to answer the Committee’s questions truthfully, and to offer the American people what I know about President Trump. I recognize that some of you may doubt and attack me on my credibility. It is for this reason that I have incorporated into this opening statement documents that are irrefutable, and demonstrate that the information you will hear is accurate and truthful. Never in a million years did I imagine, when I accepted a job in 2007 to work for Donald Trump, that he would one day run for President, launch a 1 campaign on a platform of hate and intolerance, and actually win. I regret the day I said “yes” to Mr. Trump. I regret all the help and support I gave him along the way. I am ashamed of my own failings, and I publicly accepted responsibility for them by pleading guilty in the Southern District of New York. I am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty – of the things I did for Mr. Trump in an effort to protect and promote him. I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump’s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience. I am ashamed because I know what Mr. Trump is. He is a racist. He is a conman. He is a cheat. He was a presidential candidate who knew that Roger Stone was talking with Julian Assange about a WikiLeaks drop of Democratic National Committee emails. 2 I will explain each in a few moments. I am providing the Committee today with several documents. These include: A copy of a check Mr. Trump wrote from his personal bank account – after he became president – to reimburse me for the hush money payments I made to cover up his affair with an adult film star and prevent damage to his campaign; Copies of financial statements for 2011 – 2013 that he gave to such institutions as Deutsche Bank; A copy of an article with Mr. Trump’s handwriting on it that reported on the auction of a portrait of himself – he arranged for the bidder ahead of time and then reimbursed the bidder from the account of his non-profit charitable foundation, with the picture now hanging in one of his country clubs; and Copies of letters I wrote at Mr. Trump’s direction that threatened his high school, colleges, and the College Board not to release his grades or SAT scores. 3 I hope my appearance here today, my guilty plea, and my work with law enforcement agencies are steps along a path of redemption that will restore faith in me and help this country understand our president better. *** Before going further, I want to apologize to each of you and to Congress as a whole. The last time I appeared before Congress, I came to protect Mr. Trump. Today, I’m here to tell the truth about Mr. Trump. I lied to Congress about when Mr. Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false – our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign. Mr. Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates. In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell 4 me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie. There were at least a half-dozen times between the Iowa Caucus in January 2016 and the end of June when he would ask me “How’s it going in Russia?” – referring to the Moscow Tower project. You need to know that Mr. Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it. To be clear: Mr. Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project. And so I lied about it, too – because Mr. Trump had made clear to me, through his personal statements to me that we both knew were false and through his lies to the country, that he wanted me to lie. And he made it 5 clear to me because his personal attorneys reviewed my statement before I gave it to Congress. **** Over the past two years, I have been smeared as “a rat” by the President of the United States. The truth is much different, and let me take a brief moment to introduce myself. My name is Michael Dean Cohen. I am a blessed husband of 24 years and a father to an incredible daughter and son. When I married my wife, I promised her that I would love her, cherish her, and protect her. As my father said countless times throughout my childhood, “you my wife, and you my children, are the air that I breathe.” To my Laura, my Sami, and my Jake, there is nothing I wouldn’t do to protect you. I have always tried to live a life of loyalty, friendship, generosity, and compassion – qualities my parents ingrained in my siblings and me since childhood. My father survived the Holocaust thanks to the compassion and selfless acts of others. He was helped by many who put themselves in harm’s way to do what they knew was right. 6 That is why my first instinct has always been to help those in need. Mom and Dad…I am sorry that I let you down. As many people that know me best would say, I am the person they would call at 3AM if they needed help. I proudly remember being the emergency contact for many of my children’s friends when they were growing up because their parents knew that I would drop everything and care for them as if they were my own. Yet, last fall I pled guilty in federal court to felonies for the benefit of, at the direction of, and in coordination with Individual #1. For the record: Individual #1 is President Donald J. Trump. It is painful to admit that I was motivated by ambition at times. It is even more painful to admit that many times I ignored my conscience and acted loyal to a man when I should not have. Sitting here today, it seems unbelievable that I was so mesmerized by Donald Trump that I was willing to do things for him that I knew were absolutely wrong. For that reason, I have come here to apologize to my family, to the government, and to the American people. *** 7 Accordingly, let me now tell you about Mr. Trump. I got to know him very well, working very closely with him for more than 10 years, as his Executive Vice President and Special Counsel and then personal attorney when he became President. When I first met Mr. Trump, he was a successful entrepreneur, a real estate giant, and an icon. Being around Mr. Trump was intoxicating. When you were in his presence, you felt like you were involved in something greater than yourself — that you were somehow changing the world. I wound up touting the Trump narrative for over a decade. That was my job. Always stay on message. Always defend. It monopolized my life. At first, I worked mostly on real estate developments and other business transactions. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Trump brought me into his personal life and private dealings. Over time, I saw his true character revealed. Mr. Trump is an enigma. He is complicated, as am I. He has both good and bad, as do we all. But the bad far outweighs the good, and since taking office, he has become the worst version of himself. He is capable of behaving kindly, but he is not kind. He is capable of committing acts of generosity, but he is not generous. He is capable of being loyal, but he is fundamentally disloyal. 8 Donald Trump is a man who ran for office to make his brand great, not to make our country great. He had no desire or intention to lead this nation – only to market himself and to build his wealth and power. Mr. Trump would often say, this campaign was going to be the “greatest infomercial in political history.” He never expected to win the primary. He never expected to win the general election. The campaign – for him – was always a marketing opportunity. I knew early on in my work for Mr. Trump that he would direct me to lie to further his business interests. I am ashamed to say, that when it was for a real estate mogul in the private sector, I considered it trivial. As the President, I consider it significant and dangerous. But in the mix, lying for Mr. Trump was normalized, and no one around him questioned it. In fairness, no one around him today questions it, either. A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time. The answer is yes. 9 As I earlier stated, Mr. Trump knew from Roger Stone in advance about the WikiLeaks drop of emails. In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr. Trump’s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr. Trump put Mr. Stone on the speakerphone. Mr. Stone told Mr. Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr. Assange told Mr. Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Mr. Trump responded by stating to the effect of “wouldn’t that be great.” Mr. Trump is a racist. The country has seen Mr. Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries “shitholes.” In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn’t a “shithole.” This was when Barack Obama was President of the United States. 10 While we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. And yet I continued to work for him. Mr. Trump is a cheat. As previously stated, I’m giving the Committee today three years of President Trump’s financial statements, from 2011-2013, which he gave to Deutsche Bank to inquire about a loan to buy the Buffalo Bills and to Forbes. These are Exhibits 1a, 1b, and 1c to my testimony. It was my experience that Mr. Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes. I am sharing with you two newspaper articles, side by side, that are examples of Mr. Trump inflating and deflating his assets, as I said, to suit his financial interests. These are Exhibit 2 to my testimony. 11 As I noted, I’m giving the Committee today an article he wrote on, and sent me, that reported on an auction of a portrait of Mr. Trump. This is Exhibit 3A to my testimony. Mr. Trump directed me to find a straw bidder to purchase a portrait of him that was being auctioned at an Art Hamptons Event. The objective was to ensure that his portrait, which was going to be auctioned last, would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon. The portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for $60,000. Mr. Trump directed the Trump Foundation, which is supposed to be a charitable organization, to repay the fake bidder, despite keeping the art for himself. Please see Exhibit 3B to my testimony. And it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that Mr. Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom were small businesses, that were owed money for their services and told them no payment or a reduced payment would be coming. When I advised Mr. Trump of my success, he actually reveled in it. And yet, I continued to work for him. 12 Mr. Trump is a conman. He asked me to pay off an adult film star with whom he had an affair, and to lie to his wife about it, which I did. Lying to the First Lady is one of my biggest regrets. She is a kind, good person. I respect her greatly – and she did not deserve that. I am giving the Committee today a copy of the $130,000 wire transfer from me to Ms. Clifford’s attorney during the closing days of the presidential campaign that was demanded by Ms. Clifford to maintain her silence about her affair with Mr. Trump. This is Exhibit 4 to my testimony. Mr. Trump directed me to use my own personal funds from a Home Equity Line of Credit to avoid any money being traced back to him that could negatively impact his campaign. I did that, too – without bothering to consider whether that was improper, much less whether it was the right thing to do or how it would impact me, my family, or the public. I am going to jail in part because of my decision to help Mr. Trump hide that payment from the American people before they voted a few days later. As Exhibit 5 to my testimony shows, I am providing a copy of a $35,000 check that President Trump personally signed from his personal bank 13 account on August 1, 2017 – when he was President of the United States – pursuant to the cover-up, which was the basis of my guilty plea, to reimburse me – the word used by Mr. Trump’s TV lawyer — for the illegal hush money I paid on his behalf. This $35,000 check was one of 11 check installments that was paid throughout the year – while he was President. The President of the United States thus wrote a personal check for the payment of hush money as part of a criminal scheme to violate campaign finance laws. You can find the details of that scheme, directed by Mr. Trump, in the pleadings in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. So picture this scene – in February 2017, one month into his presidency, I’m visiting President Trump in the Oval Office for the first time. It’s truly awe-inspiring, he’s showing me around and pointing to different paintings, and he says to me something to the effect of…Don’t worry, Michael, your January and February reimbursement checks are coming. They were Fed- Exed from New York and it takes a while for that to get through the White House system. As he promised, I received the first check for the reimbursement of $70,000 not long thereafter. 14 When I say conman, I’m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school, his colleges, and the College Board to never release his grades or SAT scores. As I mentioned, I’m giving the Committee today copies of a letter I sent at Mr. Trump’s direction threatening these schools with civil and criminal actions if Mr. Trump’s grades or SAT scores were ever disclosed without his permission. These are Exhibit 6. The irony wasn’t lost on me at the time that Mr. Trump in 2011 had strongly criticized President Obama for not releasing his grades. As you can see in Exhibit 7, Mr. Trump declared “Let him show his records” after calling President Obama “a terrible student.” The sad fact is that I never heard Mr. Trump say anything in private that led me to believe he loved our nation or wanted to make it better. In fact, he did the opposite. When telling me in 2008 that he was cutting employees’ salaries in half – including mine – he showed me what he claimed was a $10 million IRS tax refund, and he said that he could not believe how stupid the government was for giving “someone like him” that much money back. 15 During the campaign, Mr. Trump said he did not consider Vietnam Veteran, and Prisoner of War, Senator John McCain to be “a hero” because he likes people who weren’t captured. At the same time, Mr. Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft. Mr. Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment. He finished the conversation with the following comment. “You think I’m stupid, I wasn’t going to Vietnam.” I find it ironic, President Trump, that you are in Vietnam right now. And yet, I continued to work for him. *** Questions have been raised about whether I know of direct evidence that Mr. Trump or his campaign colluded with Russia. I do not. I want to be clear. But, I have my suspicions. 16 Sometime in the summer of 2017, I read all over the media that there had been a meeting in Trump Tower in June 2016 involving Don Jr. and others from the campaign with Russians, including a representative of the Russian government, and an email setting up the meeting with the subject line, “Dirt on Hillary Clinton.” Something clicked in my mind. I remember being in the room with Mr. Trump, probably in early June 2016, when something peculiar happened. Don Jr. came into the room and walked behind his father’s desk – which in itself was unusual. People didn’t just walk behind Mr. Trump’s desk to talk to him. I recalled Don Jr. leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice, which I could clearly hear, and saying: “The meeting is all set.” I remember Mr. Trump saying, “Ok good…let me know.” What struck me as I looked back and thought about that exchange between Don Jr. and his father was, first, that Mr. Trump had frequently told me and others that his son Don Jr. had the worst judgment of anyone in the world. And also, that Don Jr. would never set up any meeting of any significance alone – and certainly not without checking with his father. I also knew that nothing went on in Trump world, especially the campaign, without Mr. Trump’s knowledge and approval. So, I concluded that Don Jr. was referring to that June 2016 Trump Tower meeting about dirt on 17 Hillary with the Russian representative when he walked behind his dad’s desk that day — and that Mr. Trump knew that was the meeting Don Jr. was talking about when he said, “That’s good…let me know.” *** Over the past year or so, I have done some real soul searching. I see now that my ambition and the intoxication of Trump power had much to do with the bad decisions I made. To you, Chairman Cummings, Ranking Member Jordan, the other members of this Committee, and the other members of the House and Senate, I am sorry for my lies and for lying to Congress. To our nation, I am sorry for actively working to hide from you the truth about Mr. Trump when you needed it most. For those who question my motives for being here today, I understand. I have lied, but I am not a liar. I have done bad things, but I am not a bad man. I have fixed things, but I am no longer your “fixer,” Mr. Trump. I am going to prison and have shattered the safety and security that I tried so hard to provide for my family. My testimony certainly does not diminish 18 the pain I caused my family and friends – nothing can do that. And I have never asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump. And, by coming today, I have caused my family to be the target of personal, scurrilous attacks by the President and his lawyer – trying to intimidate me from appearing before this panel. Mr. Trump called me a “rat” for choosing to tell the truth – much like a mobster would do when one of his men decides to cooperate with the government. As Exhibit 8 shows, I have provided the Committee with copies of Tweets that Mr. Trump posted, attacking me and my family – only someone burying his head in the sand would not recognize them for what they are: encouragement to someone to do harm to me and my family. I never imagined that he would engage in vicious, false attacks on my family – and unleash his TV-lawyer to do the same. I hope this committee and all members of Congress on both sides of the aisle will make it clear: As a nation, we should not tolerate attempts to intimidate witnesses before congress and attacks on family are out of bounds and not acceptable. I wish to especially thank Speaker Pelosi for her statements in Exhibit 9 to protect this institution and me, and the Chairman of the House Permanent 19 Select Committee on Intelligence Adam Schiff and Chairman Cummings for likewise defending this institution and my family against the attacks by Mr. Trump, and also the many Republicans who have admonished the President as well. I am not a perfect man. I have done things I am not proud of, and I will live with the consequences of my actions for the rest of my life. But today, I get to decide the example I set for my children and how I attempt to change how history will remember me. I may not be able to change the past, but I can do right by the American people here today. Thank you for your attention. I am happy to answer the Committee’s questions. ##### 20", category: "a random feeling", likes:  2, dislikes:  4)

Even as bad as it hurt to hear growing up and fight it/convince myself it was not true, even as much as I adore women and pussy, I am a faggot….and I do not use the word to insult myself.  It is simple factual knowledge that no matter how many women I have been with, capably pleasured, and enjoyed every moment of it, a borne faggot I am.  Alpha gay men sense it in me.  Women typically do as well.  While I have sucked several cocks in my life, and done so blissfully regardless of their size or what their owner looks like, the first time a cock entered my mouth, it was a head rush and felt utterly natural.  But I am an incomplete faggot, while I have fucked myself with toys many times, the ultimate act of a cock fucking me has not happened.  Even though I was essentially begging for it.  For me, there are four stages I long to experience.  The pressure of a cock entering me, and the head popping beyond the ring of my bottom.  I want that inner moment of panic, joy, shame and horror when my mind shocks with the sensation and acceptance that I have gladly accepted a cock in my ass.  I crave the next stage….feeling that cock push deep into me, breathless as I feel a man’s balls press against my own, feel his hips press against my cheeks.  Despite the fear, there is also the craving of that cock beginning to move, to fuck me, to accept that this is not a toy under my control, this is a cock that controls me as it seeks what it wanta from me, as a man and his cock use my body for their pleasure knowing that I am so ashamed of myself yet so willing and loving every moment of it.  And then that final moment…a man about to cum in my ass, the ultimate expression of a faggot.  I want that shock to my mind and body and even my soul, even if I am in tears and begging for it to stop…the peace, no matter how upsetting it is to truly accept that this is what I am, panicking as the shock to my system screams “oh my god what are doing only a faggot would do this…”  even though it conflicts with that other screaming inner voice trying to deny it is true, please god I don’t want to be a faggot.  I have known this truth ever since the first cock entered my mouth and it was beautiful blissful peace.  No longer a guilt or suspicion, not even questioning what I was doing, whether he would cum in my mouth, whether I would swallow and want more. It is the truth that I love pussy so much, always craving the scent and taste of it in my mouth.  The concept of being in a relationship with a man is laughable and it would not have what I need in a relationship.  That only can come from a woman.  But those truths do not change what I know I am.  A natural borne faggot.", category: "a dream", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

We carried on like this until we both knew that we could not take any more.  We broke apart, she came with an almighty scream of shear pleasure and I came like I have never come before, it was beautiful.

So I started dating him and did many many voice and video calls for months, I’m not in danger, I’ve seen him I know him, I’ve seen the rest of his family and friends and I feel very safe with him.

It turned me on so much, I poured it over my increasingly wet vagina and watched as the sour clumps fell over my flesh and lips. I pressed them inbetween my fingers and they broke apart, and I felt the wetness arise even more. So I poured out more milky clumps, and pressed them into my vaginal opening and smeared them over my entire part. Some of them popped back out, but I pushed them in. They were warm as I heated it in the microwave beforehand. The rest of the milk was lumpy thick, not thin as it usually is fresh. The thick, clumpy liquid was filling me up and made me so hot. I must do it again, but now I want pure milk that is clumpy and thick. I want to have sex with this milk, but am afraid my husband will not approve. I had to clean up before he got home.

Secret.create(id: 210628, content: "In 2004, a little boy named Jimmy was sleeping in his bed. He then woke up and walked in front of his laundry room and spotted a glass antique doll with blond hair on the laundry room window ledge. He glared at the doll and screamed, “Whore! Slut! The sandwich that never knew bread!” Jimmy immediately regretted his decision as the doll glared at him and jumped off the window ledge. Jimmy ran outside faster than he thought possible and shut the front door behind him, leaving the doll trapped in the living room. However, once he ran off of his porch, his clothing vanished and he was sucked ass-first into the sky at the speed of light. Once he reached space, his naked ass crashed through the floor in his living room. His ass was sticking out of the floor in his living room whilst the rest of his body was trapped underneath his house. He couldn’t even move a single cheek! Then, his vision somehow transported into his living room, and he became a mere perspective. It was as if he was looking at himself through a security camera. He saw the doll slowly approach his ass, put its head on his asshole, and then scream, “Your scourning parading, matched! No more truly will away!” Immediately afterwards, the doll let loose a high-pitched screech that sounded like the scream of a little girl. This act inflicted extreme amounts of tickle upon Jimmy’s ass! Now that you have read even a single word of this, the same glass antique doll will suck you up into space, crash your ass into the living room, and inflict extreme amounts of tickle upon your ass! To avoid this, post this whole post on 3 different websites, or there will be no truly will away for you!

I transform into one on the full moon but it’s a little hard to walk straight with this big floppy donkey dick getting in the way. I usually jack off on people’s lawns and mail boxes I am an black woman with a deep dark secret. I’m actually a were-panther. When I transform I look like a humanoid panther with a huge bouncing black ass just like in human form. I’m in heat tonight so I think there’s going to be a gang bang in the woods with the local werewolves. 22 yr old female here with a weird problem I wouldn’t admit to anybody irl. So I woke up last night in some kind of adrenaline shock. It was like my whole body just reacted and catapulted me out of bed. I transformed into a werewolf on the spot and my pussy became wetter and more furious than any tropical storm. I ran all the way to my crush’s house and hit the door ass first. I started twerking straight through it and then shoved my werewolf pussy in his face with the door frame still lodged around my wide birthing hips. We must have fucked for ten hours straight. Is all this normal? I want to become a werewolf and fight for dominance with another one, eventually losing and getting raped by him. Corvallus is live and well at the OIA. I was dominated by a giant alpha male werewolf last night. He jumped out of the woods and stuck his giant fifteen inch angrily erect cock directly in my face. I had to back down because of how big and powerful he was. He let me live in exchange for sucking his giant member. I got a lifetime supply of protein in one night. Come by and you can get one to!! Same here mate!!! Imagine being a werewolf. A perfect marriage of strength and primal rage. None of the lies society has built in, just an honest, hedonistic and powerful creature, oozing with sexual potency. Think about not having to be human ever again. Your body contorts and stretches as your bones and muscles expand, your fangs grow painfully, and when you’ve made the change, you are a pure beast, with your sharp teeth and glistening cock in the moonlight. Raw power and rippling muscles. Hunt whatever you want to and fuck whenever you want to. Sharp claws to tear through anything in your way and a massive dick to keep your hunger satisfied I want to screw a woman or a man while I transform into a werewolf as we listen to Amon Amarth’s album “Once Sent From the Golden Hall” in its entirety When I was thirteen, I legitimately thought that I was a werewolf. I feel only mortification and resentment towards that dark time of my life. I hate my thirteen year old self so much that when I found the diary that I kept at that time, I shredded it and then burned it, all the while cursing myself and the ludicrous impression I left of myself to others. It’s been two years, and I cant look at the people I’ve told in the eyes anymore without getting flashbacks that get me into a self-wasting rage. What’s weird is that I still like the idea of a werewolf, and I LARP and roleplay with werewolf characters, but that doesn’t upset me at all. It’s just the knowledge that I actually thought that at midnight on my fourteenth birthday, I would turn into a wolfish humanoid, and the fact that I told several people that I was a werewolf, that makes me want to tear out my hair. I love the idea of a sexy creature like a symbiote encasing me in goo. I also love the idea of transforming into a large, muscular werewolf and then getting encased in goo… So I (Female, 12 yrs. old), went into my principles office. He appeared to be very happy and charming at first but when we got into his office he said, “Susanne, we need to talk about something”. Then, I said, “Alright. Let’s talk”. After I said this, he sort of frowned at his computer screen and said “hold up a minute”. He got up and walked out of the office and said WHAT IN THE? Thats when I heard the screaming. It was absolutely horrifying. This man in a bear suit was running around screaming Hi kids! I’m Pedobear! The Pedestrian bear! See me walk? I’m a Running Bear!! I’M-MARCHING-DETERMINED!!!! (He said this in rapid pace, like a. lolipop cheerleading squad) WHHHHHHEEEERRRRREEEEE AM I GOING? TO-YOUR-SCHOOL-RIGHT-NOW!!!!! YAY PEDY-BEAR!!!!! He was in a white dress and he was holding it in his outstretched arms. You could see bombs and there was a turban on his head. He had a isis flag draped over his shoulders and bin laden approves was written on his shirt. He ran right at me and there was a bulge in his pants that was quickly forming. But then he saw this retard and ran at him screaming NNNNAAAAGGGGGGGGGEEEERRRRRR!!! And he blew himself up. This happened in the morning. Its almost dinner now where I am and he had a dark web site where he said he was going to Get 72 Lolis, Inshallah. And he pledged himself to Allah. I wish I was one of them.

Secret.create(id: 210560, content: "In 2004, a little boy named Jimmy was sleeping in his bed. He then woke up and walked in front of his laundry room and spotted a glass antique doll with blond hair on the laundry room window ledge. He glared at the doll and screamed, “Whore! Slut! The sandwich that never knew bread!” Jimmy immediately regretted his decision as the doll glared at him and jumped off the window ledge. Jimmy ran outside faster than he thought possible and shut the front door behind him, leaving the doll trapped in the living room. However, once he ran off of his porch, his clothing vanished and he was sucked ass-first into the sky at the speed of light. Once he reached space, his naked ass crashed through the floor in his living room. His ass was sticking out of the floor in his living room whilst the rest of his body was trapped underneath his house. He couldn’t even move a single cheek! Then, his vision somehow transported into his living room, and he became a mere perspective. It was as if he was looking at himself through a security camera. He saw the doll slowly approach his ass, put its head on his asshole, and then scream, “Your scourning parading, matched! No more truly will away!” Immediately afterwards, the doll let loose a high-pitched screech that sounded like the scream of a little girl. This act inflicted extreme amounts of tickle upon Jimmy’s ass! Now that you have read even a single word of this, the same glass antique doll will suck you up into space, crash your ass into the living room, and inflict extreme amounts of tickle upon your ass! To avoid this, post this whole post on 3 different websites, or there will be no truly will away for you!

I transform into one on the full moon but it’s a little hard to walk straight with this big floppy donkey dick getting in the way. I usually jack off on people’s lawns and mail boxes I am an black woman with a deep dark secret. I’m actually a were-panther. When I transform I look like a humanoid panther with a huge bouncing black ass just like in human form. I’m in heat tonight so I think there’s going to be a gang bang in the woods with the local werewolves. 22 yr old female here with a weird problem I wouldn’t admit to anybody irl. So I woke up last night in some kind of adrenaline shock. It was like my whole body just reacted and catapulted me out of bed. I transformed into a werewolf on the spot and my pussy became wetter and more furious than any tropical storm. I ran all the way to my crush’s house and hit the door ass first. I started twerking straight through it and then shoved my werewolf pussy in his face with the door frame still lodged around my wide birthing hips. We must have fucked for ten hours straight. Is all this normal? I want to become a werewolf and fight for dominance with another one, eventually losing and getting raped by him. Corvallus is live and well at the OIA.

Secret.create(id: 210552, content: "Wife asks if I am going to be OK on the computer by myself after she goes to bed with baby. I say ‘yes’ and mumble something about being tired. She goes up, nurses baby and falls asleep (she is going to bed early because she is not feeling well). I quickly convene with myself and decide that it will be a good time to use porn. Part of the agreement is that I will not spend hours nor will I behave regretfully. Meet ‘Joe Porno’ – just an average Joe using mainstream porn for 15 minutes a day to get off and move on with his life. He drinks two bottles of Duff beer a night and falls asleep in a recliner. I’m no Joe Porno, but I am capable of pretending when it serves. I spent longer than 15 minutes using porn, but I was unusually committed – after flipping through a few videos I found something close enough to what I was looking for: a cute, innocent looking younger woman surrounded by men (preferably not a pack of slobs). She has to enjoy it and be enthusiastic about the whole situation. Once I found a candidate that fit the bill, I was locked in. Jumped around the timeline a bit but I didn’t last long — strong orgasm right into my underwear. I should note that I’ve smoked some marijuana. I’m still feeling kinda buzzed. I’m thinking about going up to sleep now. Thought about smoking more and listening to music, but I don’t want to wake up my people. I love them very much. Sometimes I lie to my wife or tell convenient half truths to hide behavior that might hurt her. I will not tell her about what has transpired here tonight. We have practically no privacy from each other. I have very little life of my own. I don’t go out and work for 8 hours a day. I don’t go to the bar with friends. We are all very close here in this little house. I am an advocate of living like this, but I don’t think that ‘Living in the Light’ is a complete necessity for a healthy relationship. This is one of the roadblocks I’m up against in trying to stop using porn. I’ve been trying to stop using for over 6 years. I’ve been involved in a few addiction recovery support groups during the last 2-3 years. I’m still active and talk to a man I call my ‘sponsor’ often. I meet with a few guys locally a couple times a week. I don’t always tell the full truth in these groups. I usually like to keep my masturbatory habits to myself. It still feels vulnerable to share this kind of information. Sometimes I’ll share honestly when I’m really depressed or upset with myself because I’m ashamed of my behavior and it is eating away at me. Something I don’t ever share is that I don’t really find my addictive behavior to be a problem most of the time. I’m not spending half my day setting up to get my next fix, blowing 1000s of dollars on sex workers, carrying on elaborate affairs, etc. Most of the time I’m just an eager loving guy who likes spending time with his family, playing music, cooking, problem solving type projects and being outside. Why ‘recovery’ then? Because there have been a few occasions where I’ve really felt desperate to quit — that going on ‘as is’ was unacceptable and possibly unsurvivable. I show up at meetings because I’m scared of that place. My terror is tied to punctuated moments of my life where I’ve lost myself in pornography. So, my ‘recovery’ is more about trying to save the life of the one who deep down wants to live and keep doing what I’m doing. Sometimes I choose lie about what Joe Porno is up to. He feels benign. He feels far away from the terror. When I’ve brought him up, nobody in my recovery circles seem to think he’s good to keep around — clearly part of the addiction. They are probably right. But I’d rather not nail him to the cross in one of my righteous ‘come to Jesus’ moments (I’ll be good from NOW ON!). For now, Joe Porno, bless you.

He then woke up and walked in front of his laundry room and spotted a glass antique doll with blond hair on the laundry room window ledge. He glared at the doll and screamed, “Whore! Slut! The sandwich that never knew bread!” Jimmy immediately regretted his decision as the doll glared at him and jumped off the window ledge. Jimmy ran outside faster than he thought possible and shut the front door behind him, leaving the doll trapped in the living room. However, once he ran off of his porch, his clothing vanished and he was sucked ass-first into the sky at the speed of light. Once he reached space, his naked ass crashed through the floor in his living room. His ass was sticking out of the floor in his living room whilst the rest of his body was trapped underneath his house. He couldn’t even move a single cheek! Then, his vision somehow transported into his living room, and he became a mere perspective. It was as if he was looking at himself through a security camera. He saw the doll slowly approach his ass, put its head on his asshole, and then scream, “Your scourning parading, matched! No more truly will away!” Immediately afterwards, the doll let loose a high-pitched screech that sounded like the scream of a little girl. This act inflicted extreme amounts of tickle upon Jimmy’s ass! Now that you have read even a single word of this, the same glass antique doll will suck you up into space, crash your ass into the living room, and inflict extreme amounts of tickle upon your ass!

She had kind of started acting meaner or ruder to me but I brushed it off as the sarcastic part of our friendship and it continued for several years. It wasn’t till I joined clubs and made more friends in college where I realized our friendship isn’t normal. Normal good friends don’t treat me that way. I was constantly being called annoying and stupid and she would hate on everything I liked or would do. I put up with it because we were best friends, we had memories. I had a few family members and other close friends always asking me why I put up with being treated so rudely and I never had a good answer. It wasn’t until recently when I think I fully grasped how wrongly I was being treated. I wasn’t her friend anymore I was her verbal punching bag. She is incredibly unhappy with her life and everything that goes on in it and would take all of her anger out on me. Its like she hated everything I did. I had started to become annoyed with everything she was saying to me or was telling me. She would straight up tell me how she would gossip to her only other friend or her mother about me and my other friends and how annoying we were. I didn’t know what to do. I couldn’t leave or cut her out of my life because I live with her. We started getting into little bickering fights and I started commenting back and not putting up with rude things she would say but she still continued to treat me this way. I didn’t understand how she could say such rude things to me when I was one of her only two friends. Like I said earlier coming to college has made me realize that she isn’t a friend to me. In fact i don’t think she even really likes me. I mean how are you constantly rude to someone and always say really mean things to them in such a serious way and then call them your best friend? She has been subtweeting me and talking about me more often and giving me sassier comments and I have just decided to let the “friendship” kind of die out. It really sucks because I thought we were closer than this but when you finally wake up and see what everyone else has been seeing and how awfully you’re being treated theres really no ignoring it anymore. I can’t stand around and constantly be bullied for trying to have fun and live my life. I don’t deserve it.", category: "a truth", likes:  2, dislikes:  0)

We did 3 photoshoots together over the span of 7 months, and he even published some of them in his magazine (which will not be named because I’m not trying to catch a law suit). Yesterday I found a fake account, with my photos, on instagram. The account was offering foot porn in exchange for money – from losers who have apparently never heard of pornhub. The photos used were from my photoshoots with Deon, photos that were never published, as well as simple selfies taken from my real facebook. He even took it as far as to edit my face onto photos of naked women. I have never done, and never will do porn or release any kind of n00dy photo, but he has used my personal name and information on the account and even linked it to a pateron and sleazy porno site. This is going to ruin my career and life if it does not get sorted. I found out it was him because he credited his damn self in the photos he posted on the fake account! This man was a trusted person in our community and has worked with many, many men and women for photoshoots. I can only imagine what kind of trash he is up to that we haven’t found! I am posting this here to bring light to his actions and put a stop to this because he still has not removed the account! If you are a model and know Deon, PLEASE DO NOT WORK WITH HIM. Please boycott all of his work. This is a typical case of someone using photography to be a creep and pervert.", category: "a pain", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

I have had the talk about the flowers and bees already. One day I heard the older boys talking about masturbation I didn’t want to ask what it is and asked my mom. She explained to me it was basically sex with yourself but I didn’t understand so I asked for clarifications. She explained to me it was about mimicking sex so one could feel pleasure. As a boy I more or less understood the male part but had a misconception about the female masturbation. I asked if it was about something going in and out of the vagina and she laughed and said it’s one way to do it. I nodded as if understand but didn’t actually. A few hours later I asked what does she mean by one way to do it and she then tried to explain there is something called clitoris. Again, I had seen her naked but hadn’t seen this. I just didn’t understand. She got a little mad and lifted her skirt and lowered her knickers and had me feel her vagina so I can understand. I felt very ashamed and a little excited. I hesitated for a while and touched it. I couldn’t feel and understand it at first but she guided me to the clitoris. I think it wasn’t sexual at first but once I touched her clitoris she a bit became different. I understood the idea and removed my hand. Later that day she was naked at home (it wasn’t unusual) and my curiosity prevailed so without asking I touched her vagina again. She jumped at first  but let me explore. She obviously liked it so I kept going. At some point she grabbed my butt and started massaging it. I kept touching and she at some point (I didn’t understood it then) I think orgasmed.

Spent a lot of time with her in my car, hers, and her office, where she worked alone (not the best move for a gorgeous, German blonde with an amazing, hot body..Guys would go in saying wanted to register for work, but really just to hit on or, in some cases, stalk her). Denise and I got very close, had inside jokes, and had fun together on the road. Nobody really knew how close we were. Denise was married, with two of her own kids, and, in process of adopting her messed-up sister’s kid. Denise had a full, busy life going on, between business and at home. As a result, gorgeous, blonde, leggy Denise needed stress relief fairly often. We hit the point of my providing it, sexually, on a regular basis. Kept it very well hidden from business associates, her family, my gf, and most others. There were a few suspicions, but nothing ever really said or asked. We even got confident..Ballsy enough to go to events and functions together and take pics with my arm around her thin, tight-skirted waist, and, while she usually kept her nails clean..She’d polish them for me. Little things should have tipped people off, but didn’t. If we were heading out of the area, we had two usual hotels we’d check in at under my name. We spent an overnight, Friday into Saturday, in the city, telling each of our SO’s that we were going alone and it would end too late to drive back, so, would stay the night. Denise’s husband didn’t know that I had a room for us, and my gf thought I was going alone and would stay with one of my friends who lived outside the city. There was no function or business event. We had a night out, dinner, wild, free from home sex for a day and half, then returned home. Denise and I kept this going until I moved out of the area, but not far enough to prevent us from getting together. She was heavily involved in court stuff about the kid and her messed up sister, and we still got away for a night of intense sex. Here we are, years later..And still..Nobody knows a thing.

(I would react like that too to be honest).) The child was choking and my mom basically helped him breathe again. I feel bad for not doing anything (I could’ve called an ambulance (someone else later did) or calmed down the mother or something.)

One guy sucks on my nipples as if I’m breastfeeding him, really gets off on it.

I enjoy every position, being on the bottom or the top. I’ve been the innocent virgin, a naughty schoolgirl, the patient, etc. I enjoy giving them blowjobs. I don’t mind if I only give a blowjob, I just make it even more enthusiastic, deepthroating. I have really enjoyed spreading my legs and mouth for them.

Secret.create(id: 210071, content: "Idiots post on here that the civil war was about slavery and the Confederate Flag.  Here is some truth: In 1836 Jackson refused to renew the BUS charter (Bank of the United States).  Under his watch the US national debt went to ZERO for the first and LAST time in our nation’s history. This angered the international bankers, whose primary income is derived from interest payments on debt. BUS President Nicholas Biddle cut off funding to the US government in 1842, plunging the US into a depression. Biddle was an agent for the Paris-based Jacob Rothschild Jewish banking house. A few years later the Civil War was unleashed, with London bankers backing the Union and French bankers backing the South. The Jewish Lehman family made a fortune smuggling arms to the south and cotton to the north. By 1861 the US was $100 million in debt.  New President Abraham Lincoln snubbed the Euro-bankers again, issuing Lincoln Greenbacks to pay Union Army bills. The Rothschild-controlled Times of London wrote: “If that mischievous policy, which had its origins in the North American Republic, should become indurated down to a fixture, then that Government will furnish its own money without cost. It will pay off its debts and be without debt. It will have all the money necessary to carry on its commerce. It will become prosperous beyond precedent in the history of the civilized governments of the world. The brains and the wealth of all countries will go to North America. That government must be destroyed, or it will destroy every monarchy on the globe.” Lincoln was assassinated at the Ford Theatre by John Wilkes Booth. Booth had major connections to the international bankers.  Following the Lincoln hit, Booth was whisked away by members of a secret society known as Knights of the Golden Circle (KGC).  KGC had close ties to the French Society of Seasons, which produced Karl Marx, a Jew. Booth was a KGC member and was connected through Confederate Secretary of State Judah Benjamin to the House of Rothschild.  Benjamin a Jew, fled to England after the Civil War Nearly a century after Lincoln was assassinated for issuing Greenbacks, President John F. Kennedy found himself in the Eight Families’ crosshairs.  Kennedy’s fate was sealed in June 1963 when he authorized the issuance of more than $4 billion in United States Notes by his Treasury Department in an attempt to circumvent the high interest rate usury of the private Federal Reserve international bankers. The wife of Lee Harvey Oswald, who was conveniently gunned down by Jack Ruby before Ruby himself was shot, told author A. J. Weberman in 1994: “The answer to the Kennedy assassination is with the Federal Reserve Bank.  Don’t underestimate that. It’s wrong to blame it on Angleton and the CIA per se only. This is only one finger on the same hand. The people who supply the money are above the CIA”. She referred to the Jewish banking houses all controlled by the Rothschilds.", category: "a fantasy", likes:  0, dislikes:  1)

Secret.create(id: 210033, content: "Where in the world does Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez live? She has no district office and no local phone number, unlike the state’s three other freshman members. It’s unclear if the 29-year-old lawmaker, who represents the Bronx and Queens, actually lives in the Parkchester neighborhood that has been so closely tied to her rise — even though she won her upset victory over fellow Democrat Rep. Joe Crowley with accusations that his home in Virginia made him too “Washington-focused” to serve his district. Ocasio-Cortez used her deceased father’s Bronx condo on her voter registration since 2012, and even posed in the one-bedroom Bronx flat for celebrity photographer Annie Leibovitz in a Vogue magazine profile after her stunning November election. But The New York Post could find little indication she lives there. A postal worker who delivers mail to the building said that in the last 10 years he has only seen Ocasio-Cortez intermittently, and that several months’ worth of mail regularly accumulates in the mailbox before anyone bothers to collect it. “Just because their names are on the box doesn’t mean they live there,” he said. A district office “makes government immediately responsible and accountable to the citizens,” said Jadan Horyn of Reclaim New York, a government watchdog group.  “Constituents need to know their representatives are working for them, and not for national prominence.” In the absence of a district office, and with no way to contact the rookie congresswoman, voters have resorted to desperate measures.  “Constituents come here and leave notes on the door,” said the postal worker at the Parkchester apartment building last weekend. “But it’s a waste of time.” Meanwhile, in Washington D.C., Ocasio-Cortez has rented a pad in a luxe building in the chic Navy Yard neighborhood, where studios start at $1,840 a month, according to the Washington Examiner. Her new digs feature gold-plated amenities like a rooftop infinity pool, a cycling studio with a dozen pricey Pelotons, men’s and women’s saunas, and a golf simulation lounge — but no affordable units for low-income residents, in spite of a local law that requires them, the news site reported.  Liberals say it doesn’t matter and quickly change the subject to a wide array of other topics. So apparently she lives in Washington, DC. Some life, she goes from $7,000 in her bank account to $200,000, but her supporters say she is working hard for the money.

Secret.create(id: 210027, content: "So, I met this girl on freshman year in high school. She became one of my closest friends, but around the beginning of our junior year, I developed feelings for her. It was so confusing cause I had never liked a girl before; but later that year she had a boyfriend, so I had to hide away my feeligs. Eventually, on our senior year, like a month before graduation, I confessed to her. We ended up in good terms and we continued being friends; the thing is… I told her I had gotten over her, but I hadn’t. When we started college, she had broken up with her boyfriend during the summer, so I thought about asking her out (didn’t know if she would accept cause as far as I know, she’s straight, but it was worth the shot), little did I know that around november, she had gotten a new boyfriend (I felt really low). They broke up on january and she hasn’t dated anyone ever since. Last night, some friends and I hung out cause it was a friend’s birthday. She had always been so shy and adorable, but when I arrived at the party, I was shook! She got a pixie cut, she was wearing some tight black shorts, high heel boots… She looked pretty as ever but also (I don’t really like talking about her like this) so. fucking. HOT! Everything was fine. We were catching up, enjoying each other’s company, when this song comes up and she says “man, I love this song”. She stands up and starts dancing like I had never seen her dance before; swinging her hips, going down… She was so damn sexy and was almost drooling #femaleerectiontime. I literally had to go to the bathroom and wash my face cause I was almost in tears thinking “What is she doing to me?!?!?” I flirted with her all night, but I don’t think she got the hint, walked her to her car when she left and she promised we would hang out soon. I ended up telling my best boy-friend that I had a thing for her (I trust him like hell, but he’s kinda close-minded, so I had been hesitating about that), but what had me really messed up is that I couldn’t stop thinking about her and how fucking perfect she looked and how sexy she danced and… I masturbated thinking about her. I had fantasized about us before, but I had never gotten that far. I just… Ahh! I wanna be with her! I wanna go down on her while I give her compliments in between; tell her how fucking perfect she is while we make love and just… Man, I wish she was bi and liked me as well.", category: "a fantasy", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 210017, content: "hey guys someone give me their opinions on this. So, I have been seeing a guy for about 2 months now. He is 28. I am 20. I’ve known him for over a year, he was a regular at my work and came in everyday. I have now fallen in love with him, but I cannot read him. Some days when we are together he is so lovey and touchy and seems so into me, other days he barely touches me and seems so distant. I will text him sweet stuff and instead of saying sweet stuff back he will say something like “I like that you feel that way” so it feels like he doesn’t feel the same. But, he gets jealous really easily about other guys. && the other day when I went to leave his house he really didn’t want me to go and ended up actually getting mad at me for leaving, yet he kicks me out of his house to go smoke weed in the morning every time I spend the night. When we make love he interacts with me so beautifully, looks in my eyes and smiles, makes sure it feels good for me the whole time, and touches me like he loves me. He is so polite and always grabs me if I am nearby. He tells me he likes me and that he is spending all his time on me. Today my parents invited him over for dinner (he’s come for dinner before) and he said he didn’t feel like it. I said that’s fine. If it had been the other way around, he would have gotten mad at me, I know it. Anyways, I love him and he makes me feel so happy and kisses me all day even in public, holds my hand all the time, tells me I am beautiful. But I just don’t know what is holding him back from wanting to be more than just casual… idk…", category: "a pain", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

I was the oldest of his four children (two boys, two girls) and I was the first to have “the talk” with him. What my father told me changed my life that day. He said, “Son, I’m gonna tell you what my Mother told me and all her kids at seventeen and what her father’s father told him a long time ago. It doesn’t matter who you turn out to be or what you do.  You’re family and I’ll always love you for you. Even if you’re Pa hated you. I will always love you. When you’re kids turn seventeen, tell ’em the exact same thing.” I didn’t understand the importance of it. I married a beautiful woman and I started a family of my own. We have three children. My oldest, my daughter Hailey didn’t quite react. Then, in 2015 when my second child, my son turned seventeen – he did. My son, Jackson is the big guy, the quarterback type. He loved sports and was a total “dude bro”.  My wife and I wondered how he turned out like that – I liked football as much as the next guy but I wasn’t a meathead. Last time I saw him cry, he was 11 at his Grandma’s funeral. And when I told him that, he started to bawl. In 2013, my son came out as gay to me.  He told me that he knew he liked boys since he was in third grade and he kissed a boy in the park near his school. He told me he was dating a boy named Noah. My son was close to suicide. He hid in a closet thinking I didn’t accept him. That the father he adored may not love him. I was shocked but I kept my word. I accepted him for who he was. My wife didn’t like it though. He was my son and I would love him no matter what. January 2019, Noah and Jackson got married. I’ve never seen Jackson so happy. My wife didn’t come to the wedding. In April, my third child and second son Alex will turn seventeen. And I will say to him the same words I said to Jackson and Hailey. Whatever happens will happen.

Secret.create(id: 209881, content: "I used to be a very devout religious christian-praying every night and studying the Bible but a few years ago my mom (who introduced me to God became depressed). She is one of those people who believe that God heals everything and depression and anti-depressants is below her. I looked on for years how she tried to pray her depression away but it just got worse. The last few years of me living in my mom’s house was the loneliest years of my life. A year before I moved out I met my husband and my mom absolutely hated him and rebuked me for loving him. She started twisting words from the Bible saying things like I am a satan’s slut. That I will die soon because only people who respect their parents live a long life. She felt that I was being disrespectful for not leaving my boyfriend because she disapproved of him. There was one evening where she started rebuking me in tongues. I lost my faith that night. I have not prayed or opened the Bible or gone to church since that night. I moved out of the house shortly afterwards. It has now been 7 years. I have been happily married for 5 years now and we both have obtained some level of peace with my mom even though she is still depressed and refusing treatment. My confession is that I miss God. I miss my faith. I have forgiven my mom but I still resent her for the loss of my faith. I tried going to church but the mere thought of a church leader praying how powerful God is, is something that fills me with fury because I know from experience that it’s a lie- either that or God just doesn’t care…", category: "a truth", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 209847, content: " MY TESTIMONY I am feeling utterly disgusted by myself, after all I gave into Satan’s temptation. I moved away from God’s word. I moved away from Jesus’ sacrifice. God, Oh! God forgave my sin of flesh, I gave into lust and temptation. I really don’t deserve this untainted love of yours. How could I forget the ultimate sacrifice of Christ, to laid down his own life, to shed his blood and tears for my sake and yet I dare to sin. I know if I will bow down on my knees and sincerely ask for forgiveness my kind Lord will have mercy on me I know this because I have done it before and yet his kind heart forgave me every time. But this time the regret is deeper. This time I was trying my best to not give into the temptation and resisted few times but today I break it off. If the internet is source to avail the sermons of great leader teaching us to follow Christ then why I divert to dark side of it. It’s like ‘free will‘ you decide to choose what you want to see and hear. Last day I was watching sermons on YouTube regarding love of God and today I chose to indulge into pornography and committed sin of flesh against my own body. This time I am not advocating my sin specifying body or hormonal need, because I know it was also a free will, I had the power. It’s not like I didn’t pray to Jesus to help me fight the temptation, I surely did but I think in busy life I didn’t prayed sincerely enough. I consumed so much sweet and didn’t share also I overate following gluttony. God I am in every way so imperfect and you in everyway so perfect so how could you love me. I am feeling so dirty that I can’t even pray with sin over me. Until and unless I cleaned my whole body. But how would I clean my soul. I am feeling so tired so weared out, so lethargic and Oh! God its Sunday today it’s your rest day when you are not making wonders in world and taking rest to listen to your children’s prayer and on this auspicious day I sinned. How manipulative Satan is and how weak am I. God I think if ever I will change, if ever can I break this chain, if ever be I worthy of you, I know no matter if I am sitting in mud, like a loving father you will pick me up and wash away the sin [mud], but will I be ever be able to contain myself to not disobey you and not get dirty again. Before I use to scientifically explain my sin but as I grew closer to you I realize faith, respect and surrender to Christ is beyond science. Christ you have blessed me with your grace and love, you were there at lowest point of my life when no one else was when not even my own parents could help me even if they wanted during that time I shouted at you, I cried and begged for miracle and finally that life changing miracle happened. That phase taught me no person is as important in world as much my Lord is. Every morning I wake up and thank you for all the happiness and miracles you bestowed over me and every morning I declare to surrender my life, my spirit, my body and my soul to you. But I remembered today I woke up late and forgot to say my prayer and later today I gave into temptation. Today I will not justify my sin like I previously used to do by saying only if I had a husband then I need not to lust or posing as feminist and saying God knows girls have sexual needs too and saying God made this body for pleasure or believing that it’s better to release body built up energy rather than getting involved into sexual act before marriage. As paramedical I know all about human body, hormones and needs, but apart from all the excuses I had presented before this time I genuinely asking for forgiveness and courage to redeem myself. My prayers and my faith should be stronger than my excuse. You see I just have to be the BELIEVER to welcome Gods grace in my life. I am a logical person I don’t give into every word of pastor and follow it blindly. I questioned it. After so many years of questioning I learned it may or may not be possible to follow each and every word written but it’s important to follow your heart, and my heart goes toward my Lord and my God. I know it may be latter but it would be better to wait for the man my heavenly father will chose for me and to trust His timing and His way of setting up things in my life. I know it’s not easy to give up temptation of flesh that you are committing from several years and stop it all once, I know it take time. But Satan sneakily crept into your conscience and within one weak moment you lose self control and gave into temptation. We have to keep our spiritual eyes open to detect these subtle changes and pray continuously for protection need it on. I know it could be hard but if it’s what bring me closer to Christ then it’s worth it. Like it’s been said that for your good deeds God wants to reward you and Satan knows it and want to snatch away that reward from you thus he create temptation and made you believe providing what seems like a logical reasoning but that’s his dirty trick. Of course we have free will but this free will chose God always, so that you can see Gods will in your life. Satan I might have been distracted but I am not giving in. I will always belong to Christ In mind, body and spirit. Jesus I hadn’t forgot your sacrifice. It’s just I got blinded by lust. Have a merciful heart to forgive your child. Jesus you are most important for me. I know only how alone I was how low I fall but you saved me you help me build my life from that moment onwards I dedicated it to you. I remember the pain and humiliation you endured for me, I remember the crucification and holy blood shed for my sins and yet I sinned again. My heart is heavy with guilt to know that I ignore the greatest love and sacrifice and eternal bliss for momentary pleasure. Oh! Christ forgave your daughter and held me closer to your heart and always keep me there so no evil can touch me. I promise Lord I will fight Satan with all my might and will pray thousand times to block his whispers. All I ever want is Christ and heavenly father’s grace blessed upon me. in name of Jesus Christ I surrender my life. Amen.", category: "a guilt", likes:  1, dislikes:  1)

I don’t remember much of what happened but he made me stop talking to him, which I know, I am stupid and should’ve gotten out of the relationship at that time to avoid further pain from him, but I was young and didn’t know what to do. Time went by and I would eventually text him and become friends with him again, and this happened twice of us on and off becoming friends because my boyfriend would always find out, yell at me and call me all of these stupid names and act like a whole child until I would give in and block my friend. I still regret choosing my boyfriend over my close friend of years who was there and would’ve been there for me no matter what. Then it went on to him not liking little things like what I was into, what artists I listened too and even how I dressed and dyed my hair. He also absolutely hated my friends because they smoked weed and then made me stop smoking weed, which was so stupid. He was and still is a self centered little piece of shit that was insecure of himself. My boyfriend at the time, whom is now my ex eventually broke up with me and said that he didn’t love me anymore, and after all of the bullshit I put up with from him made me realize I was the stupid one for putting up with a little boy this whole fucking time for only a average sized dick and mediocre love. It wasn’t worth all of the aggravation and yet I convinced myself months after we broke up that everything was worth it. I hate that I still deep down love and would’ve even went back into the relationship if he offered it (before, I healed and realized that I don’t love him anymore).

Here’s my confession, but first, a story: Starting from the time I was really young (probably 8 or 9) until I was in my early teens, my brother (5 years older) would tell me he couldn’t fall asleep at night unless he masturbated before bed and I let him finish inside my mouth.  I was a child and had no idea what he really wanted, so I did it because he was always way nicer to me afterwards.  Nearly every night, he would have me sit next to him on the bed or get down on my knees in front of him and wait while he jacked off, and when he was ready, he would put his penis in my mouth as deep as I could handle it and cum.  I never actually gave him head, he just wanted to finish in my mouth. So needless to say, I actually got good at it after a while, and eventually my gag reflex dwindled down to nothing. This went on for a few years until I was in 7th grade, when he was busted for bringing drugs and a gun to school.  He was sent away, and I’ve only seen him twice since then, and he isn’t doing any better.  I think he’s actually in prison right now.  I’m not even sure. Okay, so my husband really, reeeaaally loves blowjobs.  And despite my past, I still very much enjoy giving them.  I have absolutely no gag reflex, and every man I’ve ever been with swears I’m the best they’ve ever had.  I can handle every inch of most men with absolutely no gagging.  My ex used to say my oral skills would give a professional porn star anxiety. My husband especially likes how I’m able to deepthroat him all the way and stay there while he’s cumming. So here’s my confession: My highly-praised oral skills and complete lack of gag reflex are a side-effect of my brother sexually abusing me for years when I was a kid.

I really don’t think I would be suited to work in a big chain corporation that offers little progression and support for their employees, even a short term contract somewhere like that seems excruciating to me, as my previous job was like that and it made me suicidal. I’m anxious 24/7, especially over the weekend when I know I won’t be getting any new information. I’m not eating much because my benefit is so low and I have rent and I’m saving for a laptop. I don’t do much during the day other than apply for jobs on my phone, sometimes I walk to the cheapest supermarket in my city instead of taking the bus to save some money and waste some time. The other day I got lonely and went to the SPCA to hold puppies and have someone to talk to (the staff, not the dogs). I really want a job I at least somewhat enjoy at a business I like. I’m very hardworking and committed but I feel selfish for wanting it because nobody else seems to think I deserve it. Sometimes I browse at the places I applied to and the customer service sucks and I wonder how I didn’t get a job there. I think the main reason I get sad and bitter is because I struggle to see a future for myself and I have too much time to think.", category: "a pain", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 209541, content: "Hi there. I don’t expect you to read this, it is long but i need to get this off my chest Anyway. I believe that whenever something good happens to me, something bad will follow. So, to start with, when I was younger I was good at sport and art, I was also very tall, my adult height is 196cm. I didn’t mind being tall but, everytime I found something I loved, such as art, my teacher always said I was too tall to draw, i was always picked on and people always wanted to fight me. I had trouble making friends, and majority of people were intimidated by me. The following years I started to hit the gym, picked up archery and worked in an okay retail job. I finally felt like my life was back on track and my confidence came back. But then my mum let a gypsy (probably wrong spelling) woman in who used reasons like “i can move clouds” to manipulate my mum. My dad hated this. After a few weeks, my mum finally got the courage to kick her out. Finally my life was back in track again. Then, my dad went to china for a work trip and of course, the bad came back. What was this new bad? My dad cheated on my mum with a 21 year old, he was 44. So then there was non stop arguing for 2 years. Finally it was over, i felt the worst had past. I got accepted into university but, of course, i was diagnosed with stage 3 testicular cancer. So that was 4 cycles of intense chemo followed by two surgeries. Then, after two years, i was finally cured. After that, i went to university. After 2 years I came back home for the summer break to work and met the girl of my dreams, we hit it off, dated for 3 months and then i had to leave to finish my university, which was in a different state. She said she’d wait for me, but she didn’t. After 5 years, i finally finished my university degree, osteopathy, and started working. After 3 months, my right hand swelled up and i developed a stress fracture in my ring finger. This meant that i could not work for 6 weeks. So here I am now, an anxious tall guy who is afraid to be happy. And no, God is not with me. I have been through soo many trails, seen babies born without limbs and children with cancer. I don’t believe praying will help. I may be lost, but I am not defeated. If “God” is really there, then maybe he/she should come down and tell us what is the real religion. Because right now, i feel like the only relion should be fuck everything and live your life….as long as you don’t hurt anyone.", category: "a pain", likes:  1, dislikes:  1)

I had cried a lot earlier in the day so when the police showed up I was very emotionless and apathetic, not at all how you would expect an abused child to be acting. Which is why they immediately took my mom’s side. She told them lies. She only told them that I hit her, not that I hit her in self defense. She told them that I pushed her and broke the curtain, not that I pushed her and broke the curtain because she had me up against the wall with her hands on my face. She didn’t tell them that I had a video of her abusing me but she grabbed my phone and deleted the video and the pictures of the marks she left on me. And I tried to tell them the truth but they were very biased and unfair to me. Telling me that what my mom does is discipline and I can’t “discipline her back.” So they put me in handcuffs and the last thing I saw before they took me away was my mother smirking at me. I spent one night locked in a cell. I was the only minor there so I was made to put on a different uniform than the rest of the people there. They woke me up at 6 am and asked me if I wanted breakfast and I said yes, please. They didn’t give me any though, and I was scared to say anything about it. I didn’t get lunch either. I was there for about 22 hours and didn’t eat or drink once. There were insane people locked away elsewhere, and I heard them screaming and ranting all day long.

We always gave her brother shit about how she got shouted out by big instagram accounts for being hot and how big her rack was. But anyways, I’m a senior in hs and she is a senior in college. When she was home for thanksgiving this year I used the bathroom at their house. I remember seeing that huge black bra on the ground near the shower and I couldn’t resist. I busted a load of cum in that thing and rubbed it in with my dick. I continued to do this over winter break as well, but I snuck into her room and did it on clean bras so she would wear them. I remember how excited I was when I saw she was wearing the pink one I cummed in the day before. Although, I got even more malicious and I started sneaking into her bathroom and gently rubbing her toothbrush with my cum. I also cummed in her shampoo and face wash. I don’t know why I do it but I like it so much. How do I stop this? I feel like I’m going to get to the point where I’m going to cover her room with jizz. Dm me @userbdeth on instagram for advice.

And I high five him but it was a bad high five so I spend the next ten minutes trying to high five others lol Then later he’s sitting on a chair looking at memes and I’m like hey what’s up and we look at stuff until the chair next to him is free and he pats it and wants me to sit next to him (it’s kind of a tradition where we sit down and look at memes together at the end of the day) and then we’re close together again and I look cute cause the sun fell on my eyes there and then this guy who some people think I like comes and distracts me so my crush kinda grabs my hand (like strokes the top of it) to get my attention and I look back at him BUT HE WANTED MY ATTENTION SO YEEEE but then a teacher kicked us out so I hung out with my friends and he hung out with his And then when him and his sister leaves school I’m just like “oh bye (his name)” in a distracted way (cause I ain’t letting him know anything) and he’s like bye Selena Hehe he’s such a good boy and I like him so much Ok thx bye subscribe to PewDiePie", category: "a random feeling", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

We were still kind of strangers to each other at this point, and when we walked past each other, I stopped and turned around to look at him, and after a few steps, he stopped and turned around to look at me too and uh I kind of freaked out. I got really nervous because I didn’t want him to think I’d been staring at him so I tried to pretend like I’d actually been looking at the road instead of at him. Then I turned back around and started to walk away really fast. The next day, the same thing happened. We walked past each other on the sidewalk. I heard him stop, so I turned around, and he had this friendly smile on his face and he waved at me. It surprised me, but I waved back at him. And when I look back at that moment, I feel like that was his way of telling me that I could relax and that I didn’t need to be nervous around him. After that, it became our thing. I mean, we still weren’t really even friends and I barely knew anything about him, but every time we walked past each other we’d smile and wave and say hello and I got so excited about it every time. I always looked forward to it. Sometimes it was the highlight of my entire day. And it’d probably still be the highlight of my days, except now he has a car. So now the highlight of my days is when I get in his car after school and he drives me to his house.", category: "a wild experience", likes:  2, dislikes:  1)

Secret.create(id: 209437, content: "How to cheat on your wife by a happily married man… Like most happily married men I need to cum an awful lot more than I did when I was a teenager. Although most women in my personal experience are multi-orgasmic, it get boring for us men to fuck the same woman over and over again, especially when you know how she loves it. The challenge and thrill of the unknown is simply gone. Her loyalty to you is just not enough. There’s share your entire life with her pussy, one night stand and never see her again pussy, married or got a boyfriend side piece pussy, work wife pussy, short term affair pussy, long term affair pussy, my very favorite; your wife’s best friend or Sister-In-Law pussy. I’ve pretty much done it all, and will continue to do more for as long as I can. But I’m going to share with you the secret to never getting caught. If you’re going to cheat, be smart, be very smart by using a secret email address on a browser that you uninstall and reinstall regularly and get a prepaid credit card to buy a prepaid smartphone which you keep in your gym locker and gym locker only. Never bring the prepaid phone home ever! Make sure your sex dates with are always at a motel near the gym and always use your prepaid card to pay for the room. Make sure you have a no smartphone policy between you and your side chick because women have a weird fascination of taking pictures and videos of their “boyfriends” especially while they are asleep after sex. Also make sure you take a shower with her before you fuck and after you fuck her, it will help lower the strength of her scent. After you’re done fucking her, remember to take another shower and then meet up go to the gym and workout to keep you stamina up, but most important that gym sweat scent to throw your wife off when you first come home and then take another shower. As soon as you get home quickly hug and kiss your wife so she will be repelled by the gym sweat. Your hug and kiss will psychologically throw her off. After you shower seduce your wife and fuck her. You had sex earlier and you went to the gym, she will assume the workout got you aroused. Most men get busted by their wives because of a very simple thing, another woman’s scent. Women have a stronger olfactory chamber, it’s how they know you’re fucking another woman. Mask that other woman’s scent off successfully by taking very soapy showers and gym sweat she won’t find out and your life won’t get blown up. Take it from a guy who’s been fucking other women regularly ever since I was dating my wife. We have a great marriage because a variety of pussy reduces my stress. I also make more money than my wife because my boss loves my attitude and how calm I am during a crisis. Men are not meant for fucking only one woman, we need variety. The Mormons and Muslims got it right. It’s women who and Christianity that got it fucked up. So there is my secret.

She said that she has questioned her feelings for me too.  At midnight we kissed.  My wife and her BF both fell asleep so it was just us outside shooting off fireworks.  We have kissed several times since then too and have cuddled together when we are watching a movie on weekends and hanging out and last weekend, I told her just how much I really love her.  Her and her BF have 2 kids together and me and my wife have been together 25 years and I don’t want to change any of that.  I am really happy that I get to show her affection and still love my wife.  The problem is that if we get caught, she will get a divorce for sure and the 2 of them will split up.  It would be great because then we could be together and not have to hide it, but at the same time, I love my wife and want things to stay the same.

Secret.create(id: 209281, content: "I’m a guy in college, and for a while I’ve been having an identity crisis. I used to off and on send pictures, go on cam sites, and get emotionally invested in older gay men who would take advantage of my submissive nature and as soon as I would cum for them, I’d feel an immense amount of guilt and shame because I’d realize how crazily weird I am for enjoying handing over control to strangers from online, and then I’d stop for a while until I would succumb to my horniness again. I’ve been doing nofap and realizing how tainted my worldview was when I was running on that horniness. The problem is the fact that as much as I see how badly my actions in the past would affect me over and over again, and the pain it would bring me, I still have a compulsive want to return to that state where I was using online sexual interactions with strangers as an emotional escape, where I could relinquish all control to someone else. I’ve started using religion to pull me out and focus that energy onto something less damaging, and as much as it works, I still see how easy it is to go and turn to sin again and it’s really tempting. The other part to this all is trying to understand my sexuality. All my life, even when I would send pictures to other men, I thought I knew I was straight. I had always loved only girls, and this thing for older men seemed, and still seems, as just a fetishization of my fear of having to be in control. But now, doing nofap, I’ve started seeing that since I started getting involved in gay things (never in person though), I see guys, as well as girls, in a sexual way. These conflicts of sin vs virtue and man vs woman have really torn me apart and I try just to not think about it until every once in a while I realize I’m never going to live a fulfilling life if I don’t figure out who I am and what I want, and I want to live a life of longterm contentment over short term pleasure and I feel that if I were to actually get involved with a real-life man to see if that’s something I truly like, I would be damned to a life of short term pleasure because no good virtuous woman would want to be with a guy who has slept with other men, but I also feel as though if I were to be with a wife for the rest of my life, I would constantly question whether or not I made the right choice.", category: "a pain", likes:  1, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 209243, content: "I got my feelings hurt badly many years ago by a girl I was convinced that I was in love with. We were at the most, and not even all that close. I was a dumb teenager who didn’t know any better. She ended up ghosting me after I hinted that I felt something for her. I was already really depressed at the time and it absolutely pushed me over the edge. I remained convinced that she was “the one who got away” for years. The reality is that we were never really compatible and not even close when we were friends. A lot of pain for nothing. After years of pretty successfully being mature about it and not blaming her I moved away from my hometown and it really stressed me out. All the unjustified resentment I’d been burying came pouring out and hasn’t stopped. I hate her now. What it really is is extreme self-loathing directed elsewhere, but having figured that out hasn’t changed anything. I met someone else a few years back. Someone who makes me feel safe and good about myself. I never let her know in a large part because things with this other girl blew up in my face so badly. I’m afraid that I’m wrong again, or that I’ll only make things weird between us. Maybe even that I’d repeat what happened last time and eventually end up hating her too. Now she’s off somewhere else and I may never see her again.", category: "a pain", likes:  1, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 209233, content: "The Jussie Smollett thing doesn’t really make me angry — even though it probably should, since his actions will just give assholes ammunition when it comes to denying the claims of real victims of violence. It actually just makes me sad. I feel this intense, crushing sadness every time I read his name or see a picture of him or an article about the story pops up in my newsfeed. I’m not really sad for him — it’s more that I’m sad that he felt the need to do what he did. He felt so starved for attention that he made himself the victim of what now seems increasingly likely to have been a completely-fabricated hate crime. He weighed the success he’s had on Empire against the notion of pretending, for the sake of notoriety or an increased salary or whatever his actual motive may have been, to have been attacked — and decided that the potential of ruining his career and reputation and making things more difficult for hate crime victims across the world was worth a few TV interviews and the misplaced sympathy of his fans. I can’t help but wonder what was going through his mind when he decided to do what he did. Was he gleeful at the prospect of increasing his celebrity status through false victimhood? Was he nervous that the whole scheme would fall apart? Was he in the throes of a desperate jealousy? Or was he just sad, like I am? Did he just feel as though this was the only means by which he could make his life what he wanted it to be? Maybe he thought that if he was able to pull this off, he’d finally be happy with himself and at peace with the world? There is no justification for what he did, if he turns out to have been guilty of fabricating the attack on him — and I wouldn’t say that I necessarily feel bad for him — but it still hurts to know that someone so successful could be driven to such an act of desperation. It makes me feel bad about society and the state of the world.

He had a pack of wolves surround me and threatened to have them rip me to pieces if I didn’t follow his orders. So I had to strip naked and compare dicks with him. I felt like a tiny slender sapling compared to a mighty redwood. He laughed and ridiculed me for being a tiny white boy with a small pecker. He said that since I was practically a girl anyway, I might as well become his wife. So next thing I knew, there I was wearing a skirt made out of leaves as I combed the twigs and grass out of his beard. Once that was done, he pulled me onto his lap and we had tantric sex all throughout the rest of the day and late into the night.

She’s bending over getting stuff from cabinets and reaching into the refrigerator and I’m rock hard for the millionth time, but this time my cell phone whispers to me “hey M.F.er, go ahead and take a picture, it’ll last longer.” I was like, “fuck you, I’m not going to do weirdo creep shit! no.” Then all I heard was “no balls.” Now I think my cock and the phone were having their own conversation at this point because I was throbbing even harder.  I got up, said fuck it, turned on the camera and went in the kitchen and took my time grabing some napkins and ice and a spoon and I don’t know what else while I’m snapping picks and shooting video. I didn’t give a shit about the boner, if she would have asked if I “had something in there or was I just happy to see her” I would just be honest.  She knows what she’s working with. So, 2 minutes that felt like an eternity were over, small talk while she’s got her back to me, cooking something on the stove, and I walked strait from there left my random shit on the table and stepped into the bathroom and busted an amazing fat cum while actually looking at her as visually for the first time and not just in my imagination.  Washed up.  Headed back out.  Enjoyed the rest of the evening.  So if it could have gotten better than that, I would have loved it.  But I had some shit to do and while I was out I bought a night cap from the liquor store and poured a nice glass for myself when I got home.  I’m not sure how long I had been enjoying a smooth buzz while channel surfing, but here she comes again. And my fucking cock came up with some shit for me to say, making her giggle at first, kept it general, impersonal, not specific request or advance, but borderline, and I had never crossed this line before.  She was fine. It was all good.  Then I eventually brought up loving to be allowed to smack it.  She said no, I chuckled it off, we we’re in that flow.  We parted ways.  She passes me again in the hall, she had a grin, and I bit my lip with a smile and said “are you sure?  Not even once?” She said “no dude” I said ok, want you to be comfortable that I’ll never cross that line, I will respect you, I don’t want you to be uncomfortable.” I saw the tension in her shoulders ease out and she looked at me like she was wondering something.  I said “what?” She said, “I’ve noticed you showing off too.  I make you hard don’t I?” “Fuck yes, you do.” She looked square at my crotch and she started with the frisky kitty shit.  She told me “I meant what I said earlier, you can’t touch me, ever, and you better not fucking say anything about this to any one.” I asked “… About our conversation?” She said “aanything I say or do” And she turned backed into the bathroom flicked on the light, turned around and did this sexy wriggle out of those tight pants and I saw those bare delicious cheeks in all their glory lol My heart was racing I grabbed my cock through my sweats and just nodded smiling.  And then, FUCK YES, she did the little bitchy beckon with here finger for me to come into the bathroom, I stepped in and shut the door behind me and she said my sweats and showers down as she dropped to her knees and she blew me like it was going out of style.

How embarrassing that he has to stand there with it all on display. Then she makes him go fetch the paddle, which is difficult with his pants down around his ankles. But he shuffles along as best as he can and brings back the paddle. It’s such a laugh to watch. He bows down and presents the paddle to Mother. Then she has him stand up to take off his pants.

He squirms and wiggles. His one free leg thrashes about, but his balls keep him pinned in place, leaving his bare bottom unprotected. His bottom turns pink. Soon he is crying and begging. He promises to be a good boy. “What do I want?”, Mother asks. Between the crying and gasping he blurts out, “Submission, Obedience, Compliance.” Then she asks if he is going to be a submissive boy, and he is quick to blurt out, “Oh yes ma’am. yes ma’am”. Then she asks him about Obedience, and Compliance. He promises to be obedient and compliant as he pleads for mercy. His bottom now red, he begs frantically. Mother gives him some additional swats, usually about ten. She releases his balls and allows him to stand up. His penis is rock hard and bright red. The veins are swollen and it looks like the thing is going to burst as he stands there sobbing. His ball sac is firm and well formed, most likely shaped by Mother’s grip. Then she makes him thank her for disciplining him. He drops to his knees and thanks Mother for punishing him and he promises to be good. To give his bare bottom a chance to cool off, he is put in the corner with his face down and his bottom held high. His balls peek out from between his legs. His ball sac usually stays firm.

The Muslim man, who was only identified as Majd H., raped the girl outside a nightclub in the southwestern German city of Freiburg on 14 October 2018 before calling “at least nine” of his friends, who took turns sexually assaulting the 18-year-old in excess of four hours. Before being involved in the gang-rape, Majd H. reportedly had an arrest warrant issued for him over a drugs offence and was due to be detained a few days later. German prosecutors give great leniency to Muslims, but yet to their deathbeds they pursue former conscripts of fantasy alleged crimes committed when they were just 18-years old in 1945.

Look it up on Google! . The plan is to get rid of Whites and Asians because they have a high IQ which is a threat to Jewish control. Kalergi determined that blacks have a LOW IQ, which makes it easy for Jews to manipulate and deceive them. So the plan calls for blending the White and Asian races with the black race together to make all the world “brown”, except for JEWS. The brown race will have a lower IQ than the whites, and will be easily controlled. The JEWS who ONLY marry one another to keep their race pure, will have world control over the dumb ‘brown’ people. So it’s back to brown slaves, where it all started.  It was the Jewish owned merchant ships that brought slaves to the US.  It was Jewish merchants that sold them.", category: "a first experience", likes:  0, dislikes:  1)

So, we graduated from high school and I found out that he got into the same college as I do. Still, I ignore it because i know he is in a committed relationship. However, not long after that, I found out that he broke up with his girlfriend. So I thought, this is it, this is my chance, it was fate that brought us together that we both enrolled in the same college. But again, I was too late. He ended up dating AGAIN one of my friends. I was devastated. It was never meant to be. He will always look at me as his friend. This was it, or so I thought. We graduated and I found out later that we both will take the same course in our degree and we both got into the same college again. I cannot run from him. How can I move on if he is always in front of me?!!! It’s degree and I just can’t deal with him anymore, so I completely shut him down and I talk to him only when it is necessary so that I won’t fall in love with him all over again. For a second there, I did move on, I stopped thinking about him, although I still have butterflies if I ever saw him in a cute outfit. I am 22 now and I am currently doing my internship. Funny thing, he is also in the same internship programme. I don’t know why I cannot run away from him. Still, I thought that I have completely moved on from him. So, I thought nothing will happen between him and I during this internship. I will never fall for him. Boy was I wrong. During the internship, we got put in the same team so obviously I cannot escape from him. We got closer each day , talked to each other every single day and laughed with each other every day.I failed myself cause I am head over heels for him all over again.

Ava’ s one of my closest friends and even though I’m a happily taken guy I care about her very much in a platonic sort of way. About a month ago, she got busted for having weed by the police, and her father has been furious with her ever since. So just yesterday after I went out for a run with my cross country team, and I ran into her and a group of friends after our run. We hung out for a while, and then she noticed her dad had called her, so she played his voicemail and he sounded furious. He yelled at her for not answering her phone and for leaving some check at home. I thought he was way over the top about it, but I figured the worst he would do is just yell at her when she got home, and I was wrong. This morning at school, she showed up with a bruise on her collar, and her hair draped over her left eye. During the beginning of the day, I noticed she had a black eye underneath of her hair. So later that day during our home room class, she was on the brink of tears, and I asked her why she was all bruised up, but she told me it was from cheerleading practice. Not much longer she started crying telling me that she left the check at home, and her dad was going to kill her. After that she spilled everything. She told me her dad’s been hitting her and her seven year old sister for as long as she could remember, and last night her dad just went into a blind rage. Underneath of her hair, the entire left side of her face was bruised. She was in a huge panic about the check and told me in tears that she’s afraid to go home. I told her she should probably go somewhere else tonight and that I would drive her anywhere after school, but she told me if she didn’t go home right after school, it would make things even worse. We talked for a while about what was best, and she told me it’s best that CPS doesn’t get involved. Her father works pretty much all day, and when he’s home he doesn’t do anything. Ava cooks dinner for her sister, keeps her entertained, and puts her to bed every single night. She’s afraid that because Ava and her sister are related because of their dad, they will be separated and her sister will continue being abused by her family. I just don’t know what to do, if I tell somebody I risk making the situation even worse, and if I don’t, her father’s just going to continue abusing her and her sister.", category: "a guilt", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

The Muslim man, who was only identified as Majd H., raped the girl outside a nightclub in the southwestern German city of Freiburg on 14 October 2018 before calling “at least nine” of his friends, who took turns sexually assaulting the 18-year-old in excess of four hours. Before being involved in the gang-rape, Majd H. reportedly had an arrest warrant issued for him over a drugs offence and was due to be detained a few days later.

My friend who works at the district office confided in me that the district, which is heavily in debt, spent almost $250k on outside consultants and a new assistant principal position to “fix the discipline gap.” At the same time they’re cutting art and music positions because of budget shortfalls, they’re spending enough to hire three full-time teachers on “fixing the discipline gap” because many black students lack basic self control. The results have been completely predictable. Teachers are pressured to “let things slide” with the black students and nit-pick the white students in order to get the right disciplinary numbers. Classroom distractions have gone up and test scores have come down, since the black students figured out that they can get away with almost anything now. White students and their parents complain to the teachers, but there’s nothing we can do about it. It’s the district’s policies.

Secret.create(id: 208692, content: "4 years ago when I joined my new school, I made a new friend. we are both guys. my new best friend met this other girl, and oh my god she was pretty. they started dating. 3/4 months into knowing them, i started to hang out with that girl. we spoke deeply about things and had the same opinions on many things (not just my dick talking.) at this point I have a massive crush. but I couldn’t do that to my best bro so I try to let go. ff 8 months I start speaking to another girl I just met, she was sweet and we had some things in common, but I was just getting to know her. couple weeks into talking, she asked me face to face while we was out with some friends  if I had any feelings for her, and confessed she kinda liked me. I (smoothly) told her we should speak about it later when I got home. I told this girl that “I would like to get to know you better” as in, I haven’t known you that long. school break ends and my best mate comes up to me, congratulating me on my new girlfriend. I had asked out this girl, without knowing it. I played it off for the whole day. I played it off, for a whole year. I have never told anyone about that. I never will. recap: i had a crush on girl 1 about a year ago, then I accidentally asked out girl 2. I met a girl 3, who I cheated with on girl 2. I cheated on girl 2 for about 3 weeks before I broke it off with girl 2. that all happened almost 3 years ago. I have been with girl 3 for 3 years June. my terrible guilt is that; when I tried to get over girl 1, my feelings only left for a couple of months. my entire relationships i have always had massive massive feelings for girl 1. still after about 3/4 years now. i think about her a lot. I see her often as we’re still all quite close friends after these years. I also feel massive guilt for cheating on girl 2. she was innocent and I’m a prick. Girl 3 is the best I’ve ever had, but I think about how life could be with girl 1. I think I would cheat for girl 1 over my best mate, and current girlfriend. my feelings include the pain of lying, the stress of lying and the massive guilt of lying. i sometimes actively flirt with girl 1, as she is a flirty girl.", category: "a guilt", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 208674, content: "I used to drive for Uber and Lyft  sometimes. One Saturday night about two years ago I got hailed to pick up a guy, but that wasn’t the case, the guy who I was supposed to pick up put this very drunk girl asked me to take her home, he was upset with her gave me an address written on paper which is unusual With a 100 dollar bill which is against the rules, but Uber treats us driver like shit, so fuck the rules. Anyway, I thought he was getting in my car but he started to walk away and I said “hey aren’t you going to go home and take care of you girlfriend?” And walked back to tell me that he doesn’t know the girl that she just sloppily drunk at the bar they were in she was being disrespectful to herself and everyone there so sending her home before someone kicks her ass. Okay so now I’m like great. But I’m looking back at her and she seemed okay so I said let me take her home so nothing will happen to her, plus I wanted to keep the 100 dollar bill. I start driving off and about 3 blocks away she wakes up and asks where’s her purse I stop the car and open the door and took out my penlight only to see her purse on the floor and pointed out to her and we preceded to drive to her home. She then starts talking to me about how her boyfriend is a football player for a NFL team and she found out he often cheats on her. Now I usually come across a lot of people who tells questionable stories so I tend to not believe them, she then starts crying loudly and cursing like a crazy person and I ask her to please calm down so as I’m just crossing the bridge she starts screaming and hitting me in the back of my head calling me a motherfucker and bro. So I stopped my car got out grabbed her which I dropped on the road and asked her to get the fuck out. The crazy bitch then immediately smiles and laughs and says “come fuck me, you wanna fuck me?” I was not interested, especially when she just attacked me so I said fuck no and once again said please get the fuck out of my car. Keep in mind we’re in the middle section of the bridge. So she starts screaming rape, so I let her know that she was being recorded and then she starts talking shit about how her boyfriend is a big football player who has gangsters for friends and how she going to tell them I tried to rape her and they are going to fuck me up. I tell her again that she’s being recorded and no one is going believe her bullshit. She then starts demand that I give her back her purse and I said you come get your purse if you behave I will take you home she then agreed and as she was crawling on my seats to get her purse that when I grabbed her upper arms and pulled her out my car closed my door and jumped back in the drivers side and left her in the middle of the bridge. I got off the first exit and felt bad because it’s very cold outside so doubled back and caught up to her as she was almost near the exit and asked her if I let her back into my car will she chill the fuck out and she nodded yes. This time I let her sit in the front seat with me and She didn’t say a word to me until I got her home and she broke down crying and apologized to me. And I walked her to the front door of the building she lives at to make sure she was okay. Fast forward 11 months ago I went to the Birthday party of a friend of a friend and guess who was there? The crazy bitch who attacked me in my car. I was shocked and also nervous she might pull some crazy shit and cause me some embarrassment but that wasn’t the case. She didn’t mention it to me and was very social in a nice way. It was fucking weird, but realized she remembered that night and didn’t want to be embarrassed herself so it was cool. Two weeks after that party my friend calls me and tells me that the girl has been asking everyone she knew at that party about me and my friend told me he gave her my full name. So a day later she sends me a message on Facebook where she gave me her phone number and asked me to call her. I dilerberated over it for nearly a week because I was interested in what she had to say but I also feared her crazy. I called her and we had a really nice talk like at the party and few weeks of talking to each other on the phone ended up turning into us dating exclusively and it turned out she wasn’t lying about the NFL player either. This woman who I saw at her very worst and inspired me to be my very worst is now my very best friend and I can’t imagine being without her. So I’m thinking about buying her an engagement ring and asking her to marry me. Am I crazy for this?", category: "a random feeling", likes:  3, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 208666, content: "So I’m almost drunk while I’m writing this. I don’t care about spelling mistakes. A short story of mine is that I’m (almost) 27 years old from Eastern Europe, and I have never had a girlfriend, and I have never had s*x. But my friends don’t know this. I’ve told them that I was a bit older than 18 years old when I’ve lost my virginity, and since then I f*cked about 10-15 girls. But that’s all lie. And the reason is very simple. I’m fat and I have a small p*nis. From now on you can calculate the rest. So it all started with a thing that when I was about 18 years old, and I heard that almost all of my closest friends already lost their virginity (they are/were younger than me1-2 years) and I know they didn’t lie, because they had girlfriends at that time, and since I am (or better say I was) a pharmacist (chemist) they were buying condoms from me. And back then I was about 85-90kg (just for reference, now I am over 120kg, height was/is still about 173-174cm and my “tool was/is still just under 12cm”) I had some doubt that I can ever give a girl an orgasm with my “tool” size. So I started making up stories about my first s*x, and after that how many girls I had. Luckily I know how to tell stories, I almost never use the same word twice, and I honestly believe, storytelling is one of my stronger sides. So I made up a story about my first time, lies followed after that. I have a good memory, and I know to who I said what and when and how, so if I had to tell again a story, I knew what I said before, and honestly, nobody knew I was lying, and a bit I started to believe in them as well. It seemed so believeable. I was about 25 years old, when the first time I have left Eastern Europe, and went to live and work in the UK, in London. I thought  there will be a new life, new opportunities and I will finally lose my virginity. Btw I was 24 when I first kissed an overweight girl (and I kinda have a kink for bigger girls like myself, so I’m not saying because I have anything against them, on the contrary) and since that was my first time, and at that time I was drunk, she kinda noticed I was unexperienced, she didn’t say anything, jsut told me that she feels kinda I kissed someone a long time ago… if she knew that she was the first one… maybe she felt it… I don’t know. I’ve never spoke with her again. So I am working in London, and I became a night porter in a hostel. This company had 6 hostels in London, and their policy was that you can’t live in the same hostel where you live and work at the same time. And my room rent went up after 2 months when I was already working in a hostel, so I thought it would be a good idea to live in a hostel for a while until I figure out what should I do next, or where should I look for my next room. So I was living in a hostel in the same company’s hostel, but obviously not where I was working. It was about 20 minutes by walk between the 2 hostels. It was easy to get to the work by walk, and it was easy to go back to the hostel where I was living and where I had a good day’s sleep. If you were wondering: i was working from 11PM to 9-10AM. The check-out time to the guests were until 11AM. So about 10-10.30AM when I got back to the hostel where I was living, almost everyone checked out, and who were still staying in their rooms went out to explore London, so I had every day a “good night sleep”. Anyway, one day a group of younger girls arrived (between 18-23) from The Netherlands, from Spain, and from Germany (they didn’t know each other) but we were staying in the same room (24-bed mixed dorm) and almost all of them were staying over 1 week in this hostel, and since we were the “youngers” in the room, we got along quite well, like sitting down on the floor and telling stories for 5-6 hours straight. It was like getting us know each other and we became friends quite fast after the 2nd night (I was working 4 nights and had 3 days off, so I was there a few days/nights with them and participated in these conversations) So after the 3rd or 4th day there was this very beautiful dutch girl. Let’s call her Rebecca for the time being (not her real name). She recently broke up with her boyfriend, and she came to London alone to explore. She wanted to become an English teacher in The Netherlands in her local elementary school. So on this morning we were speaking about our plans. I told her that I will sleep, because I will work that night, so I need to catch up with my sleep. She went to the city centre to explore. Ok. Nothing special. I’ve slept during the day. She was away. I went to work about 10PM, she came back about 9PM and we had a little time to chat, she told me what she had visited that day. She asked me what was my plan for the following day. I said I will work that night, so I will arrive back around 10-10.30AM, will eat something and will go to sleep. She said OK. She went to sleep when I left for work. Finished about 9.30AM at work, arrived back to the hostel where I was living about 10AM. She was still there getting ready to go out. She asked me what was my plan again. I said to her that I wanted to go to sleep, because I had a busy night. She almost begged me to go with her for a walk, and since I was living in London I could show her a few places she didn’t know about (at that time I was only at the Buckingham Palace and at the Chelsea Stadium at Stamford Bridge, I didn’t explore London even I was living there about 4 months or so) So I said OK, I will go out with her for a small walk, but I have to get back to the hostel about 2PM-ish so I can have a good sleep for next night’s shift. She said that’s absolutely fine, she will continue her exploration without me after that. I agreed. So sleepy and tired me went out with her for a walk. I showed her a few of local amenities, like night clubs, bars, restaurants, a smaller museum etc. She was paying attention to everything I said. I was surprised. But who cares, I am tired and sleepy. So about 1PM she says she wants an ice cream. There was an Italian gelato shop with amazing ice creams. I said OK, we can go in there, buy whatever she wants, I’ll pay, and I slowly wanted to go back to sleep to the hostel. She said that’s fine. If I was embarrassed in my life, that was that moment. I’ve opened my wallet, and only £5 is in my wallet. I didn’t bring my debit card with myself (because why should I bring, it was in a safe place, and I didn’t plan to go out). So she had to pay for my and for her ice cream. I f*cked up. I will never apologize that to myself. But it happened. Not because I didn’t have money, I just didn’t have it with myself. So after she paid for both of us (I’m still sitting at the table embarrassed) I told her I will go back to the hostel, and told her if she wants to visit other places, she should go without me, so i quickly recommended a few places for her. She said she will come back with me, it’s almost an hour walk, she would be bored alone. So we were walking on Baker Street, and of course she had to check out all the shop windows, and dreaming about all the stuff she can’t/won’t buy, but it’s a feeling to walk through there. Anyway, about 3.30PM we’ve arrived back to the hostel. I said I want to go to sleep, but I still have to take a shower etc, but then I’ve decided to go straight to the bed, and I will take a shower just before I go to work. So she comes in to the room with me, she puts down her stuff like me, she stretches, and said she wants to take a break before she continues her walk. I can’t stress this enough, we were in a 24-BED SHARED DORM, which means there are 22 other people in the same room with us. And all of them are OUT! Nobody is in the room! I was living in that hostel almost a month, and NEVER happened this that nobody is in the room at 3.30PM!!! So I lie down in my bed (it was the very bottom one, the beds are aligned like this *****://images.furnituredealer****/img/products%2Fcoaster%2Fcolor%2Fbunks_401302-b3.jpg ) So I took down my clothes, I lied down to my bed, and she starts to change as well to her “sleeping clothes” and I’m kinda surprised, but whatever, it’s none of my business. And then the surprise came, she wants to lie down next to me, sits down next to me, and the she lays down, covers herself with my blanket, and wants to “fall asleep” next to me even when she had her own bed. I said to myself OK whatever, I want to sleep a bit, because I’ll be f*cked at the job if I don’t catch up with my sleep. So she lays next to me and slowly starts to push her back side toward my crotch. Of course I immediately went full hard, because I’m still a virgin and this was the closest ever encounter with a girl I’ve ever had. So she moves herself closer to my boner, she feels that I’m hard, but I still don’t react, I just let her know I have a boner and poke her a bit, but honestly still want to fall asleep as fast as I can. She notices this, and pushed herself totally to me… This was the moment I knew I won’t have any sleep, but I need to do something with her… So to show her I got her sign (yeah, she wants me to do something with her, I didn’t want by myself, because I still don’t know what and how to do), I hugged her, and slowly I was moving my right hand closer to her hip, then slowly to her panties, and started to slowly tease her p*ssy through her clothes. I heard she started to breath faster and I knew she was aroused, even if I’ve never experienced it before. So after a few minutes I move my hands up, and put 2 fingers on her clit directly in her panties. She screams up from joy. I slowly started to massage her clit, stimulate, sometimes put my finger in and out. She moans. She is enjoying it. I can feel on the bed that it is shaking a bit, but she doesn’t want to be loud because in any second somebody can come into the room, and we have to cancel everything. But nobody knocks, nobody comes in. I am fingering her for about 15-20 minutes, the beds are shaking, she moans louder and louder but still not enough to be heard outside of the room, just between us. Her p*ssy was so wet, it slipped in and out so smoothly I never thought it can happen to girls, I always thought that’s a myth. So I’m using my right arm to finger her, and I’m balancing myself half-sit half-laying on the bed on my left arm. So after 15 minutes I lye down on the bed, and with my left arm I touch her cheeks. Dude, if you heard that scream of joy, you wouldn’t believe. She was literally shaking because of that touch, she stretched all her body, it was unbelieveable. I’ve never felt before nor experienced when a girl came, but at that exact moment I knew she came… her fast breathing, the way her body moved, the way her p*ssy tightened then relaxed… I just can’t describe it, it was unbelieveable for me. I never knew that I can make a girl come… I pull out my right hand out of her panties, and dude, honestly I thought that’s it, she came, she will go the bathroom to freshen herself up and she will leave. I still had a bit time left to catch up with a sleep, so I can survive that night’s shift. How silly I was. After she became conscious again, she slowly reaches towards my p*nis, and wants to give me back the same. Once her hands reached, she felt something is wrong. I was still hard of course, but she felt that it’s not as big as she would’ve expected. She took away her hand. She turned around, looked in my eyes (I’ve only saw 2 times in my life that staring, and this was one of them. When you don’t stare to see his/her face, but stares through your soul, to see everything what’s beyond those eyes. I only did once in my life that staring, and I knew she did the same, and I saw in her eyes that she UNDERSTOOD what’s happening, that I don’t have a big p*nis and what’s holding me back) After 2 minutes (still nobody is in the room, which almost seems impossible because it is a 24-bed dorm and after 4PM… no way that this is happening on this very day) she’s whispering me, but I can’t hear her. I’ve asked her 3 times when I finally understood what she was saying. She said: “I will go to take a shower, do whatever you want to do with me” My dear friends… At that time I’m about 23 years old virgin… Never had a girlfriend… Never had s*x… Only kissed once in a lifetime, which was horrible for the girl… And she says this… Even when she felt and knew I had a small “tool”… Yet she said this… Against all odds in the universe… A 23 years old fat and ugly guy like me… It’s finally happening… I can lose my virginity… With an 8/10 girl (for me at least, but maybe she was 9/10)… No way… So she gets out of the bed, and slowly collecting her stuff for the shower. So I get up as well, stare at her ass (I’m an ass guy) and I can’t believe what will happen in the next few minutes, so I collect my stuff as well for shower, and I went forward and told to her in which cabin I will be in and won’t lock the door, so she can come in. I went in the cabin, and quickly washed my private parts so it wouldn’t stink because of the long walk and the work before… About a minute pass, I hear she comes in, locks the door and starts to undress. Dude, Now I say she was a 9/10 girl… Small tits, probably A cup, slim, like 50-55kg and about 180cm tall, but her ass is big as I don’t know… She covers herself with her hands like she is unsecure about her body. No way she is not confident. Then she finally shows herself. Shaved everywhere, just a bit of stubble at her p*ssy… Dude… No way she is that beautiful, fully naked in front of me. And she WANTS ME! Like this is some kind of fairy tale… “This is the day I will lose my virginity…” My brain tells me… My heart tells me… My senses tell me… The UNIVERSE tells me… So to warm up again, I slowly start to massage her clit like I did before… She moans up louder because the water is flowing from the shower and she won’t be heard that easily… Another 10 minutes pass. I lay down on my knees. I start to lick her clit. It tastes like I don’t know… A bit acidly, a bit sour, a bit bitter, but I can see (and hear)  that she enjoys it. She is moaning, grabbing my hair, and pushes my head against her… She enjoys it. She want me… Maybe because I was there at that time. But it doesn’t matter why, she wants me… When I thought she had another orgasm (and basically felt, because she was tearing out my short hair and moaned like in the bed) she collapses in the shower, can’t stand on her legs… So I stand up. She stays down for a few more moment… Then she finally go to her knees, looks at my p*nis. I don’t know, and I will never know what she thought about it’s size, about anything… But I believe she was kinda disappointed. But she must somehow return me the favour. Or at least that’s what I thought. So she was lying on her knees, and started to s*ck my p*nis… I’ve never felt that feeling before. Honestly I don’t know if she was good or bad. I have no experience. But at that moment I felt I’m in heaven. I saw on her that she was trying her best. She REALLY wanted to give me a “good time”. She meant it. She wanted to show me how good and greatfull she can/want to be. I don’t have to tell you, I didn’t last more than 2 minutes, and I came on her face. I warned her, and told me to come on her face. Now she is on her knees covered in my cum, and I saw on her face the disappointment. Not because I finished so fast, but because I think (again this is just a guess) that she wanted me to enjoy everything for at least as long as I did to her (compared to 20-ish minutes to my 2 minutes or less)… But she did it… She blew me… Now again, since I need to recover, I need a few minutes… And what to do in the meantime? So I again started to finger her. Nothing else came to my mind. If I don’t do anything, she will leave the shower unsatisfied. I don’t want that. But I felt that this time she didn’t enjoy as much as before. So I started to lick her again. Not the same effect… She needed something else. She needed that hard f*ck so she can’t get up from the floor 2 days… She needed the ultimate satisfaction. And I couldn’t deliver. I couldn’t f*ck her brain out. Finally when I regained strength, and I was hard again as a mountain (who wouldn’t be at that sight), I tried to put it in. And I didn’t reach it… We tried a few other poses, but somehow it didn’t work out, it didn’t go in. I couldn’t f*ck her… She deserved at least a 20cm, to f*ck her brain out, all I had is half of that, and even that didn’t go in. Doesn’t matter how hard we’ve tried it. If you have some sort of self-confidence, this eliminates it. This destroys it, and will never come back. And it didn’t come back for me since then (in “sexual life” of course). I am still a virgin. With no dignity. And it will never come back. Since then I didn’t kiss, I just jerk it off 3x a day, and this is how it is going in the last 3 years… I won’t ever forgive for myself what I did (or didn’t do) then. And will never be the same again. And I still need to keep up the image I built up during the years. And I will keep it that way. Just now when I’m 27 years old, I know at least why I won’t have any relationship. Because if you want a happy and healthy relationship, you need a good s*xual life, which with me won’t be possible. It doesn’t matter how good person you are, how they will fall in love with your personality and behaviour, if you can’t deliver in s*xual life what you need to bring, sooner or later someone will cheat on the partner. And I don’t want that. If once I will have a wife, I want her to be satisfied with everything I have to offer. And it doesn’t matter if I can provide for her/for us 99/100 stuff, if that part is missing, there will always be a doubt about cheating, because it doesn’t matter if I can give her 99% she deserves, if she will find someone who can provide that 1% in s*xual life, probably will cheat on me… And I don’t need that sh*t in my life. I want to provide 100% to my other half, but if I can’t deliever, it’s better not bother with that… Well, that’s my confession, but not for today, but for this millennium… I know nobody will read this whole article, but if you did, thank you. I hope you feel better about yourself. Believe me, you can do better than me.", category: "a truth", likes:  1, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 208594, content: "New discoveries in the process of cell death by Dr. Angeline Burnett In my latest theorem/thesis, I believe that cell death and Telomere length directly correlates with hormones (i.e. hormones turn a cell off/on to live or die). Thusly,hormone therapy could literally halt cell death and even reverse it. This could prove positive for not only Alzheimer’s patients but for cancer patients as well. CONTROLLING hormones being the cure. Hormonal fluctuations aggravate and exacerbate inflammation which is a known trigger for not only cell death but cell mutation (i.e. ‘cancer’). Understanding the role hormones play in body physiology is crucial finding a cure for a plethora of ailments linked to hormonal cell death. My conclusion thus far? The on/off switch to cell death is directly correlated to hormones.Hormones not only dictate our youth and decline but when they go ‘wonky’ they create cancer cells in normally healthy tissue (breast/uterine cancer via birth control). The introduction of life-threatening antibiotic resistant diseases is not coming from hospitals but from the animals we eat. This is SCARY sheet and I LOVE MEAT. Then there’s the issue that comes from eggs and chickens hormonally ‘enhanced’ as well as cow milk. *sigh* Then, you have a constant source of hormone disruptors from phalates in plastics TOTALLY messing with hormones and like …DUH!

Nobody knew I was gay. I was sort of a jock- or well, as jocky a science high nerd could get. There were girls who liked me but I never got with anyone. I’d say “studies first” as my excuse.

Secret.create(id: 208472, content: "Please. I need help. It’s a long story but please read because every detail is important and I seriously need help. Please. My best friend is in love with my husband and it’s my fault. Now she is trying to take him away from me. I begged her to stop, but she refuses, and when I try to talk to him about it he just shuts down. He has never liked confrontation and can’t stand drama and keeps saying that if we keep fighting like this then he’s going to disappear and we can fight over something else. I’ve been refusing to talk to her anymore and have blocked her everywhere but she still tries to see him. He is just trying to pretend like none of this is happening and doesn’t want to hear about it or talk about it ever. I tried to leave and she offered to stay with him so I stayed anyway. I finally talked to her about it again yesterday and cried and begged her to stop, we cried together and “made up” I guess, but she says she is still in love with him, and if we can’t share him, then she will never stop fighting for him. I am so bitter inside and hurt over this, but it’s all my fault and can’t really blame either of them for acting like this. I had to be hospitalized June of last year because of my depression/bi polar 1. I tried to kill myself twice before I was admitted and my husband had to restrain me. My best friend was involved with my last attempt and that is why I got admitted into the hospital. After I left I wrote them both a letter telling them that I didn’t think I was going to make it and would still try to kill myself while in the hospital. I told her to take care of him if anything ever happened to me because she’s been our best friend for 12 years and she was the only one I would ever trust with him. I wrote him a similar letter saying that I thought he should just try to forget about me, and that he should just marry her. They both came to visit several times until I started refusing visitation. I made 6 more attempts at the hospital and ended up being admitted for a total of 7 months. The last time they came to visit was when I was in ICU after I tried to drown myself in the shower. I made them hold hands and promise to be happy without me. We all cried and I refused visitation for the next several months. But I finally got a good therapist, and psychologist who made me want to live and I started calling my husband again. I got out a few weeks ago and my husband and I picked up right where we left off. I missed him so much and we both cried and he took me to dinner. We made love that night and I was happy. When my friend was confessing her love for my husband I made her promise as my best friend to tell me everything. She said they had made love in December after he got really depressed (it was his first Christmas without me in 10 years). But she said he felt so guilty after doing it that he didn’t even talk to her for a couple weeks after. She said she felt really bad about it but just wanted him to be happy. After they started talking again she said they discussed the possibility that I would be different if I ever got out, or that I would keep trying to kill myself and she said she didn’t want him to have to go through all that anymore. I can’t say I don’t agree with her, but I am better now and I want my husband/life back. She’s been my best friend for like ever and I don’t want this to destroy all of us either. Like I said, this is my fault but I don’t know if I am willing to give him up or share him. Please help me. Tell me what I should do. He won’t choose either of us and can’t even talk about it without crying and shutting down. I finally got him to admit that he loves her too, but said that he still loves me and he doesn’t know what to do. Neither do I. Please help.", category: "a pain", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

He invited me over to his house at least once a week, and I would politely decline. He’d say “why not? we’re friends, that’s what they do”. I got so used to him groping me and making sexual comments about “what if we were alone together ;). ” that I numbed myself by self harm. He’d find out I am pan-sexual and would make comments of me him and a girl “together in a room.” This year I finally spoke up and told my school, as it turns out, people I know have had terrible encounters with him as well. I should feel better, but now I’m trapped in horrible nightmares with him, my class is in the same room as it was with him, I see him in the hall, I get scared by the mention of his name, or seeing his friends. I can’t be near many guys without being terrified and relationships seem like a newly found impossibility for me. My anxiety has never been so bad and he is one of the reasons why I need to take my medication, to keep me calm.

Secret.create(id: 208418, content: "I was at the Chicago Auto Show with my children today. The place was crowded and a lot of people had small children with them (it was a day off of school). Everyone was getting along just fine… … except for one type of person. On four different occasions, black parents with their young children were making a scene because the parents had zero respect for any rules or social norms. They cut in lines, went around barriers into displays they weren’t supposed to go in and encouraged their children to do the same, let their children play on the new cars like they were jungle gyms, and seemed to lack any inside voice at all, particularly when they were swearing. There is a place where they let you ride along on a test drive of a Jeep over an obstacle course. This, of course, had a long line to get on. At the beginning of that long ling, you give them your driver’s license (for insurance purposes), and they give you a wrist band to go on the ride-along. They also have a height measurer for kids, to make sure your kid is tall enough to ride. I watched as a black man my age skipped the line, lifted the barrier rope, and ushered his four children into the line in front of everyone else. Then, when he got to the front and found out he had to have a wrist band, he raised hell. “Fuck this!” he said, loud enough for everyone and their children to hear.

My parents have both passed away now, so I can’t ask them about this.

He then woke up and walked in front of his laundry room and spotted a glass antique doll with blond hair on the laundry room window ledge. He glared at the doll and screamed, “Whore! Slut! The sandwich that never knew bread!” Jimmy immediately regretted his decision as the doll glared at him and jumped off the window ledge. Jimmy ran outside faster than he thought possible and shut the front door behind him, leaving the doll trapped in the living room. However, once he ran off of his porch, his clothing vanished and he was sucked ass-first into the sky at the speed of light. Once he reached space, his naked ass crashed through the floor in his living room. His ass was sticking out of the floor in his living room whilst the rest of his body was trapped underneath his house. He couldn’t even move a single cheek! Then, his vision somehow transported into his living room, and he became a mere perspective. It was as if he was looking at himself through a security camera. He saw the doll slowly approach his ass, put its head on his asshole, and then scream, “Your scourning parading, matched! No more truly will away!” Immediately afterwards, the doll let loose a high-pitched screech that sounded like the scream of a little girl. This act inflicted extreme amounts of tickle upon Jimmy’s ass! Now that you have read even a single word of this, the same glass antique doll will suck you up into space, crash your ass into the living room, and inflict extreme amounts of tickle upon your ass!

A recording also emerged of an IslamHood class with a lesson by Shaykh Shams Ad-Duha Muhammad on why Muslim girls should have children instead of careers. Islamhood segrated the children by gender and photos in its prospectus showed girls inside the Langley Academy standing at the back of the class behind boys. IslamHood hosted speakers such as Imran Ibn Mansur and Haitham al-Haddad. Mansur appeared at a 2015 IslamHood conference, telling the young attendants that those who were friends with others who were not observant Muslims would burn in hell. In a 2017 Facebook video, he referred to non-Muslims as “infidels”, “pigs”, and “kuffar” (derogatory term for non-believer). Al-Haddad spoke about non-Muslims being thrown into the fiery pits of hell at an IslamHood lecture in 2014 and he expressed approval of child marriage, female genital mutilation (FGM), and the stoning to death of adulterers and homosexuals.

Secret.create(id: 208144, content: "Background =========== I am Catholic and newly married. My wife and I signed the marriage certificate at the Registry of Marriage in Aug 2018. However, in the eyes of the Church, we are still unmarried. I am still a virgin. I never had any form of penetrative sex ever. 2 reasons for this: (1) I am demisexual, and (2) I never met anyone I wanted to have sex with until I met my wife. =========== Confession =========== I found that intimacy with my wife started decreasing since the start of 2018. While we didn’t have sex, she would reduce the number of times we kissed. Her reason: she isn’t comfortable to kiss in public. However, even in private, she would rarely kiss me. Personally, it is hurting me as my language of love is touch. In all honesty, she also only filled my love tank once. I feel like I am running on empty every day. I am afraid that she would deny me sex even after we are married in Church (May 2019), just as she is currently denying me physical affection. It may be selfish of me to say this but I question if she even desires me physically. I question if it’s because of our Catholic faith that she is abstaining from physical affection from me. I did talk to her about this more than once but honestly, nothing can be done nor has been done. I never felt so unloved in my life at this time. Her response would be: we cannot as we are not married in Church. I won’t deny you. Sadly these words just cannot bring me any relief nor comfort. Prayer just seems so blake and painful at the moment.", category: "a pain", likes:  1, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 208134, content: "I’m in my 40s, male, married for 15 years.  We have no children due to my wife’s hysterectomy soon after a miscarriage early in our marriage.  We tried maintaining a normal sex life but she no longer enjoyed it.  So, when I’ve gotten horny I just jack myself off…but even that sort of tapered off and I gave up on that, too.  I guess I became asexual. We moved recently to a neighborhood on the edge of the city that is pretty rural and wooded.  It’s not remote or anything but there is a lot more privacy here and we enjoy the nature.  We only have one neighbor close by that lives in a small cottage.  He’s an older man, seemingly retired, and other than a casual wave in greeting we really didn’t interact – at least until last summer.  I retired from my job early but wife decided to keep working.  Suddenly I was home alone a lot and began wandering the several acres with my dog, just to stay busy doing something. I walked near his home several times and although I didn’t go out of my way to notice I came to realize he was kind of an artist, always working on something – either painting or carving things.  After a time I began going out of my way to say hello and inquire about his art, etc.  Sometimes we’d have a beer and chat.  Some of his art was…racy, but I wasn’t offended or shocked. One morning my wife answered the phone and told me to run over – something was wrong.  I’d been in his living room before but no further.  I found him in the hallway where he’d fallen off a ladder and luckily happened to have his cell phone in his pocket.  He was conscious but acting strangely and I called 911 and rode with him.  He’d broken his clavicle and had a pretty good head wound, so they kept him overnight.  I made sure he was settled, taking his keys to make sure his place was secure before heading home.  He was drugged and couldn’t tell me if I needed to call anyone for him, but figured I could find an address book the next morning. After my wife left for work, I walked over to his place and let myself in.  I’d always been impressed with how clean he’d kept his place, organized, well furnished despite the small size, and much of his art displayed throughout.  I didn’t find an address book in the living room or kitchen. I surmised he’d been trying to hang one of his paintings in the hall when he fell, so I went ahead and hung it, stowing the ladder in a small utility closet off the kitchen.  Though he had never invited me to the back of the house, I thought I’d have better luck elsewhere.  There were only 3 small bedrooms and a bath, similarly decorated but one bedroom seemed more comfortable and lived in.  I opened one of his bedside tables and was shocked to find several carvings – I recognized his style by now but the subject matter threw me.  They were intricately carved cocks of various sizes,  extremely lifelike.  There were also latex dildos, all the same size, and seemed to be homemade.  In a lower drawer I found buttplugs, lubricants of various brands, and several cockrings.  I was ashamed of snooping and realizing he must use them on himself.  Was he gay? There was a small desk with an iMac computer and I thought possibly he might have some contacts for family or friends.  Luckily there was no password protection, but I wasn’t familiar enough with macs to find anything useful.  I managed to find his main documents but was embarrassed to find it full of pornography – much of it of him, using the homemade dildos on himself.  Some video as well. I shut everything down, feeling that I’d violated his privacy.  I decided to go to the hospital and check on him since it was nearly time for visiting hours.  I’d just ask him if there was anyone I could contact.  Also, I’d not mention what I’d stumbled across.  I wouldn’t want to embarrass him or reveal that I’d snooped. Luckily I found him awake and in good spirits.  Other than the broken clavicle he was ok.  He was in good shape for his age and the staff wasn’t concerned so they were releasing him.  I’d asked him if anyone needed to know what had happened and he brushed me off.  His remaining family lived on the other side of the country and he didn’t have any close friends since retiring, preferring the solitude of his small home. He was happy to return home, and thankful to us for getting him help.  He was thrilled id hung his panting since he wouldn’t be doing anything requiring two arms for awhile.  I got him settled and made him a sandwich and soup for lunch.  I realized I’d left his bedroom door open and he noticed when he used the bathroom.  He asked me if I’d gone in, looking a little sick.  I explained I’d looked around for an address book but didn’t find one. While we ate he talked a little about his family and how they fell out of touch after a falling out.  He finally revealed he’d had a gay affair and when they found out they shamed him, which he never forgave.  He finally asked if I’d seen the carvings and I said yes, I had, complimenting him on their realism and beauty. When I left he insisted on hugging me and I found myself thinking about him differently now, knowing what I knew and seeing the photos he’d taken of himself engaged with his toys.  I left, but he remained on my mind and I found myself thinking of him sexually. I’m ashamed of myself for these thoughts, but I’m excited also, to have any sexual feelings at all after all this time.  I’ll need to keep an eye on him, feeling a little responsible for his welfare now knowing that he doesn’t have anyone to rely on.

Secret.create(id: 207996, content: "My wife very recently went on a month long vacation with my two sisters-in-law and four of their cousins. After dropping her off at the airport Friday I took my car and her car out of the garage to park in our driveway instead so I could can take all of our living room furniture and put them in the garage. The reason I’m doing this is because I took my personal savings and ordered a professional multi-gym, elliptical trainer, a treadmill, and electronic boxing trainer, a heavy bag/speed bag station, a pull-up stand, kettle bells, dumbbells and barbells and mats to convert our living room into a complete home gym. My wife does not know I’m doing this and she will most likely be very unhappy when she comes to discover that we no longer have a living room, but I don’t give a fucking shit. Both my wife and I have gotten fat and out of shape and I want our sex life to change for the better. I gave up on my once upon a time slim body because I love my wife and she accepted me for who I am and somehow I lost who I am in our marriage. I’m also sick and tired of her and her sisters and friends always being our house impeding my happiness with their constant social planning and cocktails and all the dinners and other social bullshit. So this my way of putting an end to it. Knowing my wife, she is going yell, curse, and scream at me to try and embarrass me to our neighbors, but I don’t give a shit. In fact both of my next door neighbors are helping me put our furniture in the garage today so after we’re done I will let let them know to expect some very loud anger and crying from my wife who will probably not talk to me for a long time after her emotional outbursts and tirades. I’m sure someone reading this would want to know why wouldn’t I just joint a gym? Because of two reasons. I feel too ashamed of how I let myself go and I would be very distracted from people who are in superior shape than me. I need to build my confidence at home. I wish our garage was big enough for all the gear I ordered and I could use that for the home Gym I’m building this week, but it’s not and I’m going to turn 50 years old next year, so I want to dedicate myself to building the body I never had before. I grew really skinny in my twenties I had natural abs from riding my bicycle everywhere and I was a fuck machine who could have sex with women several times a day. Chicks dug me and I dig chicks, but then In my late thirties I met my wife and fell deeply in love, got married and lost myself along the way. All we both do is work from home all the time running our two businesses and she gets to unwind by socializing with her sisters and friends and I end up going out to eat because I don’t want to be around all these yapping and laughing women who invade my home night after night. She may not realize it but this overwhelming socialization of hers is depressing the fuck out of me and I’ve contemplated committing suicide a few times. I don’t want to kill myself. I want to live and be healthy and happy again. But I can’t tell her this because it would be seen as weakness, so I have to be an asshole and make this move for my personal sanity. I’m hoping that after my wife gets over her anger and sees how dedicated I am to building a new body that she will join me in our new home gym and we could get fit together and have the kind of wild and energetic sex we used to when we first met again. But if not, and things get worse then I’m going to have to be fine with us not talking to each other for however long and possibly her filing for divorce. I’m not budging on this and I’m going to build a new body and make sure she knows it, and if any of my Sisters-in-law or her friends attempts to sway me on this I’m going to politely ask them to mind their fucking business…", category: "a truth", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

Secret.create(id: 207992, content: "You are the only person in the entire world who has ever made my heart skip a beat. The last night in KL – I remember it so clearly, your gentle caresses and the embrace. I was over the moon. So ecstatic that I told you that I think that I was like you without hesitation. I so wanted to kiss you then, even before then, to accept your advances. But remembering your interest in that local hurt me. Perhaps even at the beginning there was this seed of jealousy that just prohibited me from wanting to be forthright with you. I couldn’t believe that love was just right under my nose. I couldn’t believe that I had the capacity for sexual attraction until you opened my eyes. When I left you I was so hurt. I expected you to never hurt me but you did. When you criticised my lack of shaving again, everything that you did/said that showed a lack of genuine care about me kept replaying in my mind. You always pointed out physical traits that you disliked, how you wouldn’t be with me if you could be with her, discussed the future where we wouldn’t be together, pushing the physical boundaries that I have set because I was afraid that the physical was all you wanted. I blamed the failure of us on you. I didn’t believe you viewed us as a long-term item. ‘Let’s end whatever this is’ I texted you. Just the week before you had asked if we could take a break. I felt like you wanted it to end, that it didn’t matter for you, that all you cared about was your own self-gratification. The cheap dress I wore when you caressed me in KL, that moment when I believed I fell in love, I ripped it up and dumped it out whilst crying. I still wear the dress from the night of our first kiss. I still think about you all the time. I sometimes convince myself that you did love me. That you did care. That I had so severely screwed things up that it has flipped the switch for you to not caring at all. To you wishing harm upon me even. You are the only person, so far in the world that I sexually want to be with. The last week we were together – I put aside my pride and shaved. You didn’t even care that I was looking forward to seeing you early in the morning. After the last time, even though it hurt when you threatened to go to where I lived and what it meant, said that you wouldn’t apologise for the incident, I dreamt and thought of physical things that I would have believed to be unthinkable previously. It was a big deal for me, and by extension I thought it would be a big deal for you, my dearest. Yes I hurt you afterwards. I craved communication with you, as I believed our lack of communication had caused the failure after calming down. I craved to see you again on neutral ground. You called the entire experience something you could have gotten from a magazine. You told me not to overplay the importance of our relationship. That us knowing eachother for years did not matter. That broke me. I’m broken. I know I’m still in love with the idea of you. I know I shouldn’t be. I know you don’t care about me. I wish you did. I fantasise sometimes, of somehow getting in contact and visiting you where you are at now. Hoping to just grab a coffee together to talk things out. Ironically we’ve never had a coffee together in our city, only overseas. I remember when I called it a huge downgrade. How I regret that now. I know I’m unwelcome. I understand that this is unwelcome. But I only have so much willpower. This keeps my insanity in check. It gives me temporary relief from knowing that I will never find love. Those feelings that were within me when we were together. I understand that I will never feel then again and that hurts. I wish I had never felt them in the first place, I was fine with being alone before the fact. But after, after has been an extremely painful endeavour. I wish I was stronger. I wish I had your level of resilience. I wish I could just not care Imogen Cortis-Jones. I secretly do want you to see these. To read these to understand that it’s been 3 years now, and for the rest of our lives, that I have and will think of you daily.

Shes indecisive and a bit I dunno the word for it I guess um, insecure? She told me shes never had sex but she was raped when she was younger, So I was slow about it I kissed her she didn’t kiss back I touched her and she closed her legs slightly but not all the way, I even tried to get on top of her but she didn’t lay down at first until I told her to. She is really odd to me and I don’t understand her sometimes.

So I kept going and I she kept putting her hands to my neck but she always does that even when we play fight and stuff but it wasn’t like tight or anything it was a rather weak grasp and push to the neck so I removed her hand a couple of times I told her it was going to be alright and to trust me so she wouldn’t be so tense and than I tried to penetrate. I don’t get it and I don’t understand her at all, she kept saying please and shaking her head no and I’m sorry a lot but she didn’t physically push me off of her. I told her to hold on to me if it hurt and she did but awhile after she started crying and pushing me away I just couldn’t I pulled out and got off of her I said I was going to go because I was getting tired and frustrated with her but then she apologized and told me no that I could keep going and do what I wanted to her If I wanted to, I’m confused?

Richard Branson has released a video address unveiling plans to throw a major party and music concert on the Venezuelan-Colombian border, titled Venezuela-Aid Live. The event is set to take place in Cúcuta, Colombia, where the US is stockpiling “humanitarian aid” (and massing troops and military equipment) for Venezuela in a ploy to overthrow President Nicolas Maduro. Branson is asking for donations to the event. The US intends to install a puppet leader, Juan Guaido.  Branson who is working with puppet Juan Guaido, said many Venezuelans will be on the verge of starvation or death soon.  Branson failed to mention that the reason is the US sanctions against Venezuela which prohibit other countries from buying its oil. Juan Guaido plans to accept a massive loan from the IMF which will impoverish the people for generations to come while they pay back the loan.  The people will have to accept an “austerity program” while the IMF bankers reap vast wealth from Venezuela. However, his plan received a mixed response online. Some mocked the call to donate from a man who is worth billions, while others advised paying attention to problems closer to home. One person said, “Surely you and your rich mates could sort it, instead of keep asking hard working people who are struggling in this economy to Keep their own families afloat.” Another commented, “Another Tax dodging do Gooder… Before going to other countries, sort out your backyard first. Look at the alarming rates of homelessness, food banks etc in the UK. No appeal for that eh?” Yet another said, “You’re more wealthy than 90% of twitter users, why don’t you donate some of your billions instead of asking people living day to day.” One person said. “All bullshit. The US should stop the sanctions that have contributed to this crisis, and stop planning interventions.” Unfortunately there are those who compliment Branson on his plan by calling him, “the coolest guy ever”.  Some just don’t know that the Rothschilds own all the banks and control the world thru the financial system.

When mike (FAKE NAME) and I met, he was dating one of my friends, who i also consider a great friend, i’ll call her Jannis (FAKE NAME.) Jannis and Mike broke up after 3 months, but Mike and I kept talking since we were basically therapy for each other. He knows about my cutting addiction, depression and anxiety, and I know about the problems in his family, and his really deep fears. So basically about 4 or 5 months after they broke up, the Mike guy had dated a bunch of different people, since he hates being alone. Then he didn’t date anyone for a while, and he told me he loved me. I didn’t know what I felt for him at that point, so I kindly friend zoned him which he was fine ( I think, probably not but who knows) with. About a month after that, I confirmed that I had fallen in love with him. Jannis doesn’t know that we still talk as much as we used to, she knows we talk but she doesn’t know that it actually increased to hours every day. All I know about there break up was that it was messy and Jannis hates Mike now. I feel like if I tell Jannis I like Mike, she will hate me and do that thing where they warn you not to and shit when he is honestly the most kind hearted person ever, so much so he got me to stop cutting. I also have no clue if Mike still even likes me, but he has only dated one person since (they broke up) , unlike when Mike and Jannis broke up when he went on so many dates with different people. I’m terrified that things will get weird between us, and if he did actually still like me, since were so young (under 18, won’t say age) we would break up and we wouldn’t even have the friendship.

Israel has pushed the idea of a “war” against Iran for decades. Iran sits atop a list of countries Bibi and the Likudniks want to take out. It was “mission accomplished” in Iraq and Libya, but a failure in Syria. Iran is a tough nut to crack and not a pushover like Iraq (where twelve years of brutal sanctions worked to soften the country up prior to the Bush dynasty’s second round of “creative destruction”). If you believe there are multiple meanings of the word “war” in Hebrew and Bibi misspoke or his true meaning was lost in translation, you’re not paying attention. The Israeli state is eager to kill Iranians and flatten Tehran in similar fashion to Aleppo or Fallujah. Iran understands there is no shortage of homicidal lunatics in Israel, most prominently Bibi who would like you to believe “war” means something entirely different in Hebrew. A former tank commander said Israel has the “right” to defend itself, but didn’t bother to enlighten on the particular threat the Jewish state faces — flush with billions of US dollars and military hardware— courtesy of US taxpayers. Bibi hopes to put together an Arab force for an invasion, thus making sure Arabs and Americans—the latter will undoubtedly be sucked into this quagmire—die to make Israel safe for apartheid and rabid settler serial murder of Palestinians. Rudy Giuliani was on hand to give a speech urging violence, murder, and social and political chaos in Iran. So was it really a  “Peace Conference” in Warsaw, Poland or actually a “War Summit”? Since this involves JEWS, no one will dare comment!  Plenty to say about Arabs, Blacks and etc!!  But JEWS are off limits!!

The Al-Miftah Institute had ‘IslamHood’ classes on its campus in Slough, England.  IslamHood hosted speakers with “controversial” views about homosexuality, meaning that homosexuals should be hanged, tossed off of high buildings, castrated, tortured and beheaded.  (Just Mulsim love.) The school featured women in hijabs making social media videos describing non-Muslims as “pigs” (to be raped and slaughteted).  (More of that Muslim love). A recording also emerged of an IslamHood class with a lesson by Shaykh Shams Ad-Duha Muhammad on why Muslim girls should have children instead of careers.  Islamhood segrated the children by gender and photos in its prospectus showed girls inside the Langley Academy standing at the back of the class behind boys. IslamHood hosted speakers such as Imran Ibn Mansur and Haitham al-Haddad. Mansur appeared at a 2015 IslamHood conference, telling the young attendants that those who were friends with others who were not observant Muslims would burn in hell.  In a 2017 Facebook video, he referred to non-Muslims as “infidels”, “pigs”, and “kuffar” (derogatory term for non-believer). Al-Haddad spoke about non-Muslims being thrown into the fiery pits of hell at an IslamHood lecture in 2014 and he expressed approval of child marriage, female genital mutilation (FGM), and the stoning to death of adulterers and homosexuals.  (Yes it’s all LOVE and Peace from the Muslims) Local “moderate” Muslims all declined to comment.

Secret.create(id: 207840, content: "I’m an ER doctor and have seen my fair share of suicide attempts. I’m not supposed to, but after I save the ones I can save, I usally spemd some time alone with them to figure out why they would hurt themselves. I sit with them and just hold their hands, if they want me too and most do just want human contact. The most common reason: mistreatment from family. I had a young man, who just got out of prison, and he was raped. He thought he could confide in his family about what had happened to him and they all made fun of him for being “gay” or “homosexual” instead of lovong him and helping him. There was a young girl, just 12 years old who swallowed a whole bottle of Advil and Aspirin. I saved her life from a stomach bleed. I spent an hpur with her, hugging her and holding her hands. Her reason? Her parents were divorcing, her previously loving father abandoned a memtally ill mother, and rendered her, her mother, and brother homeless. There are also a lot of suicide attempts from lonely people who weren’t lucky to have a family or if they did at one time, their family members died. The lesson here: be grateful if you have a family. Love them. Hug them. Kiss them. Tell them you appreciate them. Do fun stuff together. If they are struggling, even if it spunds trivial to you, support them. Be thankful to them. Hold their hands. Curl up on a family sofa, cuddling, reading a book together. Eat together. But most importantly, never abuse anyone- emotionally, physically, or sexually because of your anger. Leave your anger from work, school at the door and enjoy your family.", category: "a truth", likes:  4, dislikes:  2)

That’s why only the bad guys have these things and they know they can home invade your home and rape and murder you and your family and theirs not much you can do about it. Cops come fill out paper work and investigate most likely find no one. The cops don’t protect you .They come when its all over. If you want to be safe you have to protect yourself. You go to a state like Texas , People do bad things but when the cops get there on the seen the bad guy is most likely laying on the ground dead. Like the church shooting ,Guy went in there killed those people guy ran out a passerby had a riffle in his truck and chased him down and when the cops got there he was Dead. If the people don’t defend them self no one will and you will be a victim. In Texas you go in some old lady’s house ,thinking she a easy victim for home invasion and she puts a shot gun in your face and blows your head off. So most criminals there think twice before doing it. Here your just a victim . NY city is no better that’s why there is so much crime.

Secret.create(id: 207782, content: "A lot has changed for me recently. I was a casual, until the 6th of September… That day is going to remain forever in my head, because that day, I caused a car accident: I got into the car too sleepy, there was a huge fog, and at some point, at the intersection, I didn’t see the truck incoming from the left, I drove out and the side of the car got hit with the truck moving around 40 km/h – the driver side was hit, and I can’t accept the fact that I, as a driver, got out without any injuries – not counting cut hands, while my mum had 10 broken ribs and my grandma had broken cheek bone. At first, doctors suspected that my mum could’ve had broken spine. I cried non-stop for the whole day and for the whole next day. I just cried. My hometown was fairly small, mostly occupied by eldery people. When people found out about the accident from TV, newspapers, internet, they already know who caused it. When I went to the hospital with my dad to check on them, everyone was looking at me like at a murderer. I remember that at the evenings I used to call my friends for a 5-minute chatter: I wanted to ask them what’s up etc, just to get my thoughts off the accident. Suddenly, most of them stopped picking up, and even texting back. I considered suicide at a certain point – the level of stress I had just overwhelmed me, I wanted to end it. Every night I lied down crying in bed like a little girl. Fucking little girl. My studies started at November and when I moved out to a different city – I wanted to commit suicide even more. This lasted till October, and afteron – everything was just alright. I got back to my normal state of being, I was a casual boy like before, but am I? The February started and my insecurities and stress started to move in again. I started to percept myself as ugly: both when it comes to the body and face. I’m working on the body since November, but I can’t accept my face. And one thing that really irritates me is that… Every single one of my friends already have girlfriends or boyfriends. Some of them tell me how awesome their time spent together was, how awesome their date went. I dated a couple of girls, but I never found the right one, the right kind. The feeling that everyone is better off than me when it comes to relationships is just making me feel… Lonely. And stupid. And ugly. And incapable of love. Incapable of anything. I’m an introvertic person, yet I can’t deal with obsolete loneliness. Even when… Even when I’m out in the city now. I smile to every girl around my age as I pass them, yet only few of them smile back. I’m mostly being ignored – when a girl sees that, she’d immediately turn her head the other direction, like as if she didn’t want to look at me. I started a journal of thoughts at the very beginning of January. I think I will continue my journey with it.", category: "a pain", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

(well, I’m not telling myself Im right), but sometimes it’s just hurting to hear people said about it.. (I should be aware cuz I get myself into this shitty situation) to start, Im into this popular online game where I met the man who change my life. I was so addicted to this game, then this guy’s let’s call him “z”, he was so sweet, friendly and very mysterious. I don’t know why the moment I started talking to him in a forum my heart lit up I cant contain my smile.it took months and I can’t believe myself that I’m actually searching for this guy.. and finally we communicated.he said he likes me too and we both agreed that we want to create this relationship (me not knowing his married). after months of chatting he finally confess that his married and has a boy child. of course I was hurt cuz he kept it a secret, but my fault cuz I was already drawn to him and willing to take the risk.. we started dating,(privately seeing each other). that is the time I started to get away with my friends and family (keeping secrets from them), of course it’s very frustrating when u want to tell the world what u feel inside but then u have to keep it to urself in order not to face humiliation and judgmental lines from people around u. honestly, the guy is not rich, has no work but he has his own way to live. (u would think I demand money or material from this guy, not a thing) the fact that every time we talk he makes my day complete. I’m a degree holder, a public servant, a regular worker with my very own house. ( u would think I’m so stupid) maybe! my family and friends always tell me that whoever the guy I’m gonna marry would really be so lucky. (I’m stable that’s what they said) but, everyday I’m suffering from guilt, pain and forbidden to tell my feelings. everyday I hear people talk about broken marriages, my friends, colleagues it’s a topic.. they always talk about it, and I was just there listening to their comments and not saying anything. it’s very hard especially my man and I are now reaching our 4 years secret relationship.( honestly, I’m not proud. everyday guilt is eating me, I’m a si ful woman. how many times I planned to break up with him but seeing the pain on his face makes me change my mind everyday.

Secret.create(id: 207686, content: "In 2004, a little boy named Jimmy was sleeping in his bed. He then woke up and walked in front of his laundry room and spotted a glass antique doll with blond hair on the laundry room window ledge. He glared at the doll and screamed, “Whore! Slut! The sandwich that never knew bread!” Jimmy immediately regretted his decision as the doll glared at him and jumped off the window ledge. Jimmy ran outside faster than he thought possible and shut the front door behind him, leaving the doll trapped in the living room. However, once he ran off of his porch, his clothing vanished and he was sucked ass-first into the sky at the speed of light. Once he reached space, his naked ass crashed through the floor in his living room. His ass was sticking out of the floor in his living room whilst the rest of his body was trapped underneath his house. He couldn’t even move a single cheek! Then, his vision somehow transported into his living room, and he became a mere perspective. It was as if he was looking at himself through a security camera. He saw the doll slowly approach his ass, put its head on his asshole, and then scream, “Your scourning parading, matched! No more truly will away!” Immediately afterwards, the doll let loose a high-pitched screech that sounded like the scream of a little girl. This act inflicted extreme amounts of tickle upon Jimmy’s ass! Now that you have read even a single word of this, the same glass antique doll will suck you up into space, crash your ass into the living room, and inflict extreme amounts of tickle upon your ass! To avoid this, post this whole post on 3 different websites, or there will be no truly will away for you!", category: "Other", likes:  1, dislikes:  2)

Once he’d pulled his cock out he told me to “clean him up”.  I’d never done it before but I’d seen girls in porn do it.  I hesitated but he grabbed my head and pushed his still hard cock into my mouth.  It tasted different to normal, but I did as he told me.  He looked so smug with himself, he kept looking at me as I sucked him.  He pulled his cock back out of my mouth and asked me if I liked that taste of my ass.  I felt so shocked at what I’d just done all I could do was smile and giggle. Il never forget the next 5 minutes in my whole life, and il probably always fantasise about it.  He ordered me to squat and said he wanted to see me push his cum out of my asshole.  Again, I was shocked but by this point i was so horny I’d have done just about anything, so I did as he asked.  I just wanted to turn him on as much as he had done.  I felt his cum slide out of my asshole and onto the floor.  My pussy was soaking wet at this point and I just wanted him to fuck me again.  I thought i was going to get my wish when he wrapped his hands around my neck.  He pulled my head towards him and whispered in my ear “now are you going to be a good anal slut and clean that up too?”. So there I was, a strong independent woman.  Naked in front of my boyfriend.

Secret.create(id: 207654, content: "trigger warning, please be aware. — for the past two years, i’ve been feeling really, really low. i do things that make me happy, yet i always end up feeling empty and sad. two years ago, i got mono and had to stay home from school for a week. during that time, i missed out on a lot of major lessons, so when i went back to school, i was confused. at the time, i really didn’t have that many friends, so nobody wanted to help me out with the homework, and i was left without a clue on what to do. i could’ve asked my teacher, but guess what? i was extremely shy and anxious, and i thought i’d bother her. my grades started slipping, and soon, i had almost straight f’s. my parents screamed at me all the time, and always told me how much of a disappointment i was to them. i started to really dislike myself, all because i thought my parents didn’t love me. and one day, i cut myself. they weren’t deep, they were only like cat scratches, but they were there. and i didn’t regret it. i tried to kill myself in the school bathrooms with ibuprofen, but after taking a lot (not too many), i got scared and cried. i remember walking back to my class and just staring at the wall, really hoping i would die. i didn’t, obviously, but my stomach hurt really bad the next day. the last time i tried to kill myself in 2016 was when i cut myself really deeply. i was bleeding really, really bad, and i seriously thought i was going to die, so with my other arm, i wrote a suicide note. when i was done, i just laid down and hoped i would pass away in my sleep. when i woke up, my wrist stung and my blanket was bloody. i hid the note under my bed. i cut myself all the time and continued to take ibuprofen even when i didn’t have a headache. but in march of 2017, my mom found my note. she and my dad screamed at me and told me i deserved to be locked in an insane asylum. they called me an attention whore and my dad even told me that he was going to call the cops on me. the day they did this, i was with some people walking in town. i was having a good day, i was finally feeling something other than sadness. but then they called me and told me to get home. in june of 2017, i discovered bts. they make me so, so happy. honestly, they’re the only people keeping me alive right now. this year, i’ve gotten so much worse. my dark thoughts happen constantly, and i can’t stop them. my parents don’t care about me. my only friend left me because i tried to tell her i was thinking about killing myself. nobody cares. my school counselor was my only hope, and i can’t talk to her any more. she always tells me the same things, and they aren’t working. it’s so hard to keep living. i know life is supposed to be hard, but why is it like this for me? i know i’m selfish, i know but i can’t deal with this anymore. i can’t deal with the weight that’s always pushing down on my chest. it’s becoming too much. i know this is long, and i’m sorry. it feels nice getting this off my chest. it really does.", category: "a pain", likes:  0, dislikes:  0)

I would stop and get fuel or something to eat at truck stops down south and at the check out counter they would sell fire works. So I would buy some rockets. I lived in South Amboy NJ and would park my truck in Woodbridge township and when I would drive over the bridge going home in my car I would light some as I was driving and hold out the window as they took off and went up in the sky and blew off. It use to burn my hand a little.It was fun.One day I was at truck stop and they Had a Mother of all rockets. It was Huge like 4 feet tall and 3 inches wide. I said I have to have it . I paid a lot for it. It was to go up and blow up and send out 12 block busters and then they would blow. (WOW) So I bought it threw it in the truck and got back on the road heading home. No the state I live in fire works are illegal. I got back to the yard where I park truck and took rocket put in car. I was heading home on bridge and wanted to see it go. But it was big and I had a hard time handing it and getting it lit . By time I got the fuse lit and out the window I was off the bridge on rt9. I was holding out the window as I was Driving . I then thought this is one big hell of a rocket I could get burnt bad holding it.So  I tossed it up and then I seen it go off in my mirror . It went across the Highway right pass a white cars windshield on the other side of the road and in to an Exxon gas station bounced twice and hit the boot where the guy is in and blew up and sent the 12 blockbusters all over the parking lot. As I was driving away I could see the flashes in my rear view mirror and hear the explosions of the block busters going off.  I said holly shit. I drove home went in my house turned off all my lights and went to bed hopping the cop’s were not going to show up at my house.  They never did ,Thank God. The guy at the station must of thought it came from the white car?  The guy in the gas station probably thought it was a terrorist attack and shit him self. Lucky the place did not blow up. He probably was on the next plane back to India . But that was the last time I bought back fire works. NEVER AGAIN.", category: "a truth", likes:  2, dislikes:  2)

It was wrong and I cannot justify my actions because no matter the reason it was wrong but I never thought twice of grabbing the opportunity to talk to her, be at her side, hold her hand, walk her home and end the day with a hug or a kiss. She was probably still hurting from her previous relationship at that time and I was in a long distance relationship yet despite such circumstance she opened herself to me and accepted me. We started spending time and everything simply clicked. I loved spending time with her and I don’t even know if I made her happy but I am sure she made me happy, she provided me with an escape from the stress of being a graduating student. Her time is precious and should have been given to someone who deserved it and yet she gave it to me, someone who did not deserve a second of her time. We both knew it was not going to end in a good way especially for her but we continued for sometime. When the day came it all ended, I thought I will be fine and not even be bothered but my idle thoughts keep going back to how things could have been if I waited for a bit longer for her to arrive and meet her. I keep thinking as to how things could have been if we were actually together. I thought giving it time and being away from her might make the thought just fade away but it persisted until now. Writing this confession might help ease this feeling of wanting to be with her. She deserved someone who will choose her first and will only choose her. She could have made better memories with those days when she was spending it with me but she chose to make memories with me. Someone else probably deserves all the hugs, the kisses, and the time she gave me and how I wish I was that guy. I don’t know how she felt towards me but I am thankful for every moment I spent with her. I love her and this is probably the only place I can admit it.

You have been warned and you god damn fucking know better.  Yes, I also have the hot water running in the sink.  Yes, I know it’s wasting water.  I will turn if off after my first cup is made and in my hand.  This will trigger the hot water heater to kick on and reheat the water as it refills.  There is a reason for this 2.  Take my first shit of the day.  That first cup of coffee gets everything moving, in addition to preventing me from committing murder. 3.  Piss.  It is critical that this occurs AFTER I take my morning shit.  If I piss first, I can’t shit.  I don’t know why.  This is just how it works.  Don’t disturb me of do anything that may throw my body’s natural reactions off. 4. Shower.  This is the final leg of the journey to assume some semblance of humanity.  The bathroom must be HOT.  Don’t fuck with my heater. I pay the fucking electric bill so that god damn bathroom must be like the tropics.

Some actually believed us, but, in reality..We had a standing room at a hotel on the road, fucked at my house at least ten times, spent an overnight at a casino hotel after a function, and even had sex in her old house after it was up for sale. Yes, they were all correct. She and I were going at it like crazy animals. We lied saying we weren’t, but most of you knew better.", category: "a truth", likes:  1, dislikes:  1)

They told me the shake machine was down they already cleaned it. I was pissed off and had to just get soda . So as I pulled off I went into the muddy grass ,I was driving a F350 supper duty pick up with 7.3 L turbo Diesel . I ripped up the grass and mud all over the side of the building and the next car in the drive thew also got covered in mud . This was the white Castle on rt9 in Old bridge NJ. It destroyed the side of the building ,I don’t think they ever could get it cleaned then they redid the whole building. I hope they think twice now when some one asks for a shake at night.

He liked me more than just a friend though. For months, he really liked me,  my feeling was off an on until one day I really fell head over heels. It was amazing for the first 7 hours, then for some reason, he fell out of it. He just stopped liking me like that. I can’t stop thinking about him. Ever. Every five minutes he’s in my thoughts. I’m wondering what he’s doing or what class he’s in or if he’s facetimed me or dm’ed me or snapchatted me. The pain in my heart is so indescribable. “Crazy someone that can make you the happiest can make you the saddest” That’s from IFHY by Tyler, The Creator. I’ve been listening to that song on repeat because every single word describes my situation. It hurts so bad. I try to talk to him normally ever since that incident happened where he stopped liking me and it was awkward, but I feel like he’s slowly starting to hate me. I think we should just stay away from each other and out of contact for a while but he doesn’t realize how much I fucking need him.

Secret.create(id: 207350, content: "I have this relationship that I haven’t experienced before where this guy and I (I am a female) are very good friends. We have shared a lot about each other to one another, hold hands on occasion, passionate hugs and have shared a kiss or to. We have not ever had sex and it is something that we both are not interested in doing with each other. What I haven’t experienced before is the fact that is all he wants, affection. Nothing else and nothing more. We have shared our feelings for one another and we are ok with what we have together but it seems a bit off. It’s like we are together but not. We both like this relationship we are in and I know it’s an ego boost for both us, the tiny thrills we give each other when we touch and the intense closeness in the bear hugs we share. In a committed relationship (which we don’t have) partners share a lot of emotions with each other whether it be about personal things or intimate thoughts. We have both done this with each other too. The information that we have shared with each other could easily get both of us in trouble with our normal daily lives. Today he went on a date, with someone else. I said I was happy for him (though I really don’t particularly like this woman). He had told me that he was afraid to say anything to me because he didn’t know how I would feel. I thanked him for telling me and wished him a good time. Honestly I got jealous. He also wants to keep what we have and I agreed to it, but now I think I should have told him no. Now I have a pain, not only in my heart but my conscience.

She  tried quitting smoking- she just can’t! she has been a heavy smoker for years ans had been smoking everyday since middle school and smoked heavily all through high school and college and for a decade and a half after college. At least Two or three packs a day for over twenty three years. She knows she can never quit She’s a lot older that me and in fact we first met when she was my freshman English teacher in high school 6 years ago… I had an unbearable  crush on her and sent her secret valentines cards and flowers after her divorce She had lost a baby to miscarriage and her husband divorced her and cheated on her with a younger woman and she was wrecked She was convinced she was never going to have a baby and used to cry in class everyday I would stay with her after class after school for tutoring and she would just cry and cry and I would tell her it would be alright Truth is I was constantly turned on the entire time and I went to see her for tutoring in English all through high school everyday after school it was the highlight of my day. I even wanted to ask her to senior prom 3 years ago – she was a chaperone so I just watched her there the whole time last year in October I saw her again right after I turned 21 and we were both in a court mandated Rehab class for alcoholism Turns out We have both had a lot of DWIs and we both have a lot of drinking problems so we went to a bar after class and we hit it off immediately She insisted it was a bar with a patio where she could smoke I fell in love with her all over again. All of her. Truth is I’ve always been in love with her since high school I wasn’t sure she was ok with the age gap or the fact I had been her student We tried breaking it off for a month or two but I missed her so badly I couldn’t take it So we kept texting everyday the whole time we were broken up last November She kept texting me during Christmas about how lonely she was She was absolutely miserable when she tried to quit smoking for a New Years resolution and she was crying all the time We weren’t even officially  dating and her attempts to quit were driving me crazy! I told her it would be ok if she smoked a cigarette whenever she needed She gave up on quitting in 2 days after this New Years resolution failed She thanked me so much for telling her it would be alright to smoke again she asked me out for drinks We ended up hooking up while drunk. No condom or anything. I didn’t know she wasn’t on birth control anymore She’s 36 and was telling me that she desperately has the baby fever Now she’s texted me this morning that she’s pregnant and we have a baby on the way due in October!!!

One instance where she really pissed me off was when class ended and I’m trying to get out of class with like 10+ people behind me who also want to leave, and she’s standing r i g h t  in the freaking doorway with her friends, talking. I tell the people behind me to stop pushing because there were people in front of me and I couldn’t do anything about that.

Secret.create(id: 207128, content: "My first encounter of a remotely sexual nature happened in kindergarten. I couldnt have been more than 5 or 6 years old. During class I sat at a table next to a kid named Jesse. He whispered in my ear and asked me if i wanted to do something that felt good. Naturally being a child and curious I said yes. He then stuck his hand down the front of my pants, not into my underwear but outside of it. He just rubbed me, and told me I had to do the same. I became nervous and uncomfortable, understandably confused for a kid my age. I had hesitations, but he talked me into it, saying everything was going to be okay and that it was only fair, so I did (again in front of the underwear). After a bit I took my hand out of his pants, feeling terrible. We didnt talk about it after that. I felt guilty about it so I never mentioned it to anyone. At least for a few years. Flash forward to me being like 9 or 10. I had a huge guilty conscience, so one night my parents were tucking me into bed and I began crying. I confessed to them what had happened. I was terrified they would hate me because of course they told me about my private spots where nobody was allowed to touch, and I let it happen. The consoled me and asked me who it was. Well I couldnt remember the kids last name because he had long since switched schools and I told them I didnt want to get him in trouble. I never talked about it again, and my parents never brought it back up. It doesnt horrify me or plauge my thoughts. I do think about it from time to time though, and now that im older I am wondering if this could have been sexual assault? Was I sexually assaulted? Can children in kindergarten even sexually assault each other? What scares me the most is how he knew about it. I knew nothing about sex when I was that age, I didnt even explore my own body at that age. It made me think that he could have been sexually abused as a kid.

For the most part, my days are mundane, spent running from patient to patient to make sure their vitals are ok and that their recovering as they should be from surgery or injuries. I should mention that I’m married to a wonderful man whom I love. But one day we had a sixteen year old girl come in tonget her tonsils removed. The surgeon took off her robe, which I found odd, but who our mostly male-dominated team seemed to treat as normal. She was a fit young sexy blonde girl and I have to say for the first time in my life i felt attracted to someone of the opposite sex. Well, we finished up and I was assigned what we colloquialy refer to as her “looker-after”. Lame, but we have oue own language. My feelings only intensified when i went into the hospital room when her parents and two older siblings were there. I have a habit of sitting on the bed next to my patients and placing my hand on their stomach or their face when i check up on them. It’s something I do as a female to both sexes to offer comfort, and though the men seem to appreciate it more, no one ever minds it. Well, there was something different about this girl. When i went in and placed my hand on her stomach and checksd her heartbeat, mine was racing as fast as hers. Maybe it was because her whole family was there but I felt the room get hot, and studdered out an excuse and left as quickly as i could. When i went back the next day, her mom was sleeping on the chair next to her. I took my stethoscope and placed it on her chest after a few minutes of chitchat after i had sat down next ro her. I could hear her heart start to beat faster and mine too. Her mom was fast asleep. I’ve never loved anything more than flustered men. There’s something powerful about pleasing flustered men and for the first time in my life this was no different with a sixteen year old. I took a chance and placed my hand on her sromach above her mound and asked her how she was feeling. She seemed unable to speak and uttered an “ok”. So i rubbed her tummy up and down with my and and watched her close her eyes. “is there anything you need Amanda,” i asked. “No,” she said. I kept rubbing her stomach and her eyes stayed closed. “If you need anything, let me know,” I said, sliding my hand down to her hard mound and watching her slightly flinch. “Ok” I then started rubbing her clit, and she looked so beautiful and flustered next to her mom. Slowly, I rubbed her off for several minutes listen to her heart beat faster and faster and eventually working my other hand down to her breasts. When i couldn’t hold back anymore i took off my pants and slowlu got in bed with her, making sure not to make any sounds, while she slightly opened her eyes and looked at me like i was retarded. I saw the signal and turned to look at her mom’s grandmotherly face—she barely had an eye open and winked at me with it. So i quickly parted her legs and started scissoring her while she looked ahead with a furrowed brow with an emotion that could only be described as simultaneous disgust and pleasure until I came. When i did and turned to look at her she was scowling at me, but when i got off the bed her grandmotherly mother’s eyes were wide open and she was smiling at me like if i had just fucked a degenerate’s daughter in front of her. It gave me the courage to smack her daughter in the ass and tell her that “I’ll be back tomorrow,” while winking back at her mom, putting my scrubs back on and moving on to my next patient.", category: "a first experience", likes:  1, dislikes:  0)

Because I’m athletic and good looking, I was tapped to entrap men in public sex stings.  Basically, I’d go and hang out in local parks, rest areas, etc. (really where ever we got reports of homosexual acts being committed), and if I sensed someone was there seeking a homosexual encounter I’d lure them into making an advance (yes, there is actual training for this).  Most of these dudes I popped were trolls, older married fucks who were desperate for any kind of attention –  some closet cases. It is/was pathetically easy to encourage them to make a move.  Something as simple as adjusting my crotch if walking around outside, while making eye contact, and they’d pounce.  Sometimes if indoor in a men’s room I’d position myself at a urinal and haul my cock out and make sure they could easily see it.  Sometimes I’d have to encourage it by stroking myself to erection in order to garner an advance.  If they did, they got popped…cuffed…charged…photographed…and also shamed by having it printed in the local newspaper.  I didn’t love doing the actual arrests because of that in particular, but it was my job. But…I didn’t and don’t ALWAYS make an arrest.  If the dude is hot I actually do feed them my cock, and sometimes fuck them.  Given that most cops don’t actually want this duty, I consider it a perk of the job.  I also use these particular men as CIs to entrap other, less desirable dudes, in order to keep my arrest quota up. I’ve been moved off the duty now and then, but I always somehow seem to manage to piss off the right person and get tapped to return to the “undesirable” duty.

Secret.create(id: 206988, content: "I woke up in the darkness in total bliss.  My cock was utterly rigid as the mouth suckled on my swollen head and the wet sucking sounds were delicious, as were the feel of the grip of a warm hand on the base of my cock and the other which had a grip on my ballsac.  Both hands were moving in time with the sucking on my head and I couldn’t help but moan in ecstasy. . Fully awake now I realized where I was.  I was visiting the home of my old friend at his invitation, but these weren’t his hands or mouth and the realization hit me.  It was his step son!  I gasped and pulled back the covers and revealed him in the dim light of the guest bedroom.  In shock and horror I sat up and pushed him away from my cock, and the sucking sound of my thick member pulling out of his mouth was very loud. . My heart pounding, I whispered “Omar, you can’t do that!  You are a boy and too young to understand.” . He just giggled and drew closer and said, “Shhh, uncle…I know how to please a cock like yours and have been for many years.”  He gripped my still erect cock with his small hand and began to stroke again.  “Lie back, uncle…you are just having a very pleasant dream.” . It was true I was having a pleasant dream.  Too much wine, and too many memories of the time spent with my friend in our youth, when he would do the things this young boy was doing now.  The boy returned to his ministrations in earnest, licking and sucking my rigid cock and pumping the shaft with one hand, massaging and tugging my full balls with the other. . I was too far gone in bliss to do anything but lie back and enjoy his work.  He giggled when I moaned and groaned and sucked harder.  Suddenly he stopped and moved to squat over me.  I tried to stop him.  He was too little!  He pushed my hands away however and settled over me, holding my cock in place as he lowered his asshole to my cock. . He fucked himself onto my rigid dick a little at a time, easing more and more of the head into him until it finally popped passed his sphincter.  We both moaned and I felt his tiny hole squeezing my cockhead, trying to adjust.  “You are so big, uncle!” he moaned but continued to lower himself further onto the shaft. . Finally his tiny ass settled onto my dark bush and he was still, except for his asshole which was clenching and relaxing around my throbbing cock. . “Please, uncle..fuck me…I am too tired to move now.” He whispered, his torso resting on my hairy belly and his small head lying on one side of my furry chest. . Shamefully but knowing it was too late for anything else I wrapped my furry arms around his back to hold him in place and began to pull my cock out of his vicelike asshole – but only until the head remained before pumping it slowly back into him.  So tight! . I continued to pump in and out of him slowly, and he keened and moaned beautifully…small fingers wringing in my chest hair when I bottomed out in his hole. . “Faster, uncle…harder, please!” . His asshole fully lubricated with his spit and my precum, I began to pick up the pace and became an animal, rutting in his wet hole.  I opened my eyes to see him looking into mine as I plunged in and out of him, his tiny mouth open in an “O.” . It was too much to bear and I buried my cock as deeply as I could into him, and I began to squirt ropes of cum into his hole.  I was aware of nothing except looking into his small face, wide eyes, and open mouth…and my cock flexing in his tight asshole as I shot my seed deeply into him. . Silence was we lay locked together until my cock softened enough and slipped out of his quivering asshole.  His labored breathing as he recovered from the experience, his small body quivering – mine too, but in the aftershocks of my fading orgasm. . Suddenly a voice from the door shook me from my recovery. . “Excellent, son…now let uncle get some rest.  It’s time you took care of your father, now!” . The boy giggled and jumped from the bed, running to his step father’s arms where there disappeared down the hall. . I remained in bed, shocked and in awe.", category: "a lie", likes:  2, dislikes:  1)

I brought in last night two homeless men (one was a sex offender and the other an alcoholic). I couldn’t see them suffer anymore in the freezing temps and snow. It took at least 30 minutes for their clothes to come off because they were actually frozen to their skin. I let them take showers. I fed them a nice hot dinner. I gave them some of my deceased husband’s clothes and pajamas. After grooming them up a little, they looked like handsome gentlemen. I have two guest bedrooms; I offered to let them stay until spring. When I went to hug the sex offender goodnight, he nearly jumped out of his skin in fear, he thought I was going to beat him. That made me so sad thst people have to treat others like dogs. Someone must have abused him for him to react so fearfullly. We actually had a nice dinner and conversation and we played poker and watched tv. I always talked to them when they were homeless but I never realized just how these people need love to grow, maybe even more love than anyone else.

I’m in my 30s now, and divorced because I can’t keep it in my pants.  I don’t have any regrets about it, and still let sex many of my decisions.  I prefer sexual encounters of the “once and done” variety, to be honest, although I do like having a “someone” around full time for companionship. . My cock isn’t particularly special, in my opinion.  I’m about 7″ but also uncut and thankful to have a healthy foreskin that is plenty loose enough to complete cover my shaft even when full erect.  My cock is on the thick side, also, and I love how it looks especially when I wear a silicone cock ring – I’m veiny already, but when I wear a ring the veins really pop and it looks so fucking sexy to me. . I’m blessed with large balls, too.  They are higher and tighter than I’d prefer.  Over the last few years I’ve been attempting to stretch them.  I’ve invested in heavy ball weights that I’ll wear at home when relaxing and it’s helped.  More recently I’ve purchased silicone ball stretchers that I can wear all the time.  The difference is noticable, especially in warm weather. . When I’m out and driving, I love to take my cock and balls out of my jeans and show it off – stroking my hard cock and massaging my balls – generally limit who I show it to.  Mostly I target truckers who can easily see it while I pass them on their left.  Sometimes I’ll let guys in work trucks and vans have a peek, too – especially if they have out of town/state plates. . I fuck a lot.  I’m constantly on hook up apps for pussy and ass.  I love fucking.  My preference shifts from male to female, but I’ll admit hooking up with guys is easier and better suited to the fuck and go situation I prefer.  Somehow fucking with men seems more honest as well.  Men can’t fake a hardon.  Men can’t fake a cumshot.  I still fuck women, but it’s a lot more work.  Most of the time, I’m pumping a man’s asshole and I’m cool with that.  They don’t expect as much, either. . I’m strongly considering having a Prince Albert piercing done.  I think my fat cock would benefit from it.  I’ve fucked several guys who are pierced and they tell me orgasms are a lot more intense.  I’d love to peel my foreskin back off my hard cock to reveal a big heavy steel ring.  Sounds so fucking hot and makes me leak precum to think of it. . God damn I love my cock so fucking much.", category: "a truth", likes:  3, dislikes:  2)

However, most people see me as having low intelligence and I don’t know why. I have a mild speech disorder which makes it difficult for me to express my ideas in an organized, coherent manner. Sometimes, I believe, people think I sound “stupid” because it’s difficult for me to express myself. I do not know how to overcome this, but I think my problem extends back to my childhood when everyone in my family would make fun of my speech problem instead of getting me any meaningful help. My mother even refused me free speech therapy my school offered when I was in 3rd and 4th grades because speech therapy was handled in the special education department and she said she would have felt like a failure as a parent if I was sent there. Today, I’m embarrassed to go on job interviews, meet new people, make presentations, or anything that involves me speaking. I feel like I sound like an idiot. I have always been a good writer and wish that writing is the only way I could express myself. I feel trapped because whenever I try to explain anything acadmeic, I usually get laughed at. Less than a year after graduating college, a new doctor I saw said, and I quote, “She is pleasant and cooperative but appears developmentally impaired.” Maybe my speech problem is why I have a knack of getting out of trouble because people believe I am developmemtally impaired.

I saw  his year book photo when he was a track star in high school and he was a total god. He’s a little weird and other than the occasional fat chick, he doesn’t get alot of pussy. When I moved him I told him I was straight, but I’m actually bi. One weekend morning he was walking around in his boxer briefs and it was the first time I noticed his tiny rock solid buns. We’d hang out together and one night after going out drinking we were talking, and he hadn’t gotten laid in a while. I confessed that I was always curious about sucking a guy’s dick and blowing him till he comes. He smiled and his response was really? I told him I would love for him to be my first. Told him it would just be between us- no one else would ever find out. He actually agreed but only if I accepted that he would not reciprocate in any shape or form and that’s all I would do is suck his cock till he comes. We also agreed he would keep his underwear on. He stood up, I got down on my knees. I not only caressed his bulge, but also squeezed and rubbed my face against those cute buns. After massaging his balls and cock, I sucked and licked his shaft until he tensed up and came . His load was gigantic. It felt like warm pudding shooting all along my tongue, the roof of my mouth .

Was a techno club, took MDMA and drank plenty of alcohol. He started dacing close behind me, then with me. Inbetween we sat down, started talking about our sex lifes with our SO and eventually made out a bit. We left soon after, since we had the same way home, but stopped by a kids playground on the way for funsies. We found one of these big round swings, were multiple kids could fit on so we decided to just kinda snuggle up in there since it’s friggin cold outside. We just talked about random shit, then he started to make his way up under my shirt to grab my breasts. I chuckled and asked if he liked them. He just said yea, they’re soft and so incredibly warm. Then I asked him how big his dick was bc I could see it kinda throbbing under his pants. But he just unbuckled his pants and asked if I want to check it out myself. Since I was hesitant, he proceeded to grab my hand and put it on his dick. It’s the second dick, I’ve ever touched in my life and I was literally shocked about how thick it was. So fucking thick, I’m still getting wet about the thought of it. After getting off the swing we continued walking into a kinda dark area, where no one could see us. I sat down on a kind of wall thingy, he sat down next to me and grabbed my hand again to put it around his dick. He was throbbing like hell and moaning, even though I didn’t do much. Just stroking slwoly and caressing his tip a bit. He was in and out of it, since he took a bit more MDMA than me, but kept on saying “What are we doing…this is wrong…but so good”. I agreed and kept saying it’s fine since…it doesn’t mean anything really. We stopped soon and proceeded to get home to our loved ones. We were both just horny, but still love our SO over anyone. We didn’t fuck, and I didn’t even gave him head or got him close to cumming …it was just a bit of fooling around. Today we didn’t even talk about last weekend and it seemed like we bot decided to just forget about it.

I’m going home tomorrow night and then we will cuddle and I’ll see if my dick comes back to life because it’s pretty much dead after wringing it out daily for the last year which was a year without sex. I want her to have a nice hard dick and I hate it when that goddamned thing conks out. You can masturbate with little or no erection but you can’t have mind-blowing sex without a fat, heavy, pulsating, throbbing penis. I can’t bear the thought of having a dead dick forever, and they say the only thing for it is to quit masturbating.

When I apologized for something terrible I did, and I was forgiven, it actually physically felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders. I breathed easier. I felt better about myself. Some questions to ponder… -Can everything be forgiven? -Do prepetrators ever deserve it? -Why are people so afraid to ask for it and or give it? -If we gave it out more often, would people be happier? -Are we allowed to forgive on behalf of others? -What if forgiveness led us to even love those who we thought were monsters? -Is a reason we hate to forgive because we would be forced to see the perpretators as human, just like us? And we couldn’t imagine ourselves capable of doing what they did? To be honest, I think guilt is the worst punishment a person can have.

Part of me wondered whether her words were partly her defending her own lies or something, it just doesn’t sound right at all. So then I pointed this out, mentioned how it seemed like she then thought that I lie and that this wasn’t helpful to do, and let her know I won’t message her again because why would I, we clearly don’t see straight. Then a while later I get this massive message which says she wasn’t calling me a liar, but repeats ‘everyone lies’, then says ‘well, almost everyone’; says I probably don’t want to admit I lie occasionally (which I don’t, and which contradicts her saying she wasn’t calling me a liar), calls me immature and criticises me for not listening to her side of the argument. What argument??? I mean seriously, I don’t understand; what can I do if someone criticises me for my understanding of what they say if they use a word then change their meaning after the fact, and when they both say they AREN’T talking about me and they ARE?

Secret.create(id: 206212, content: "I just turned 18 yr old male finishing my senior year in high school. My parents got divorced last fall. I moved with my mom to the city. I never once heard my mom and dad having sex, I’m sure they did, but they must not have done it much or they were real quiet. My mom has a boyfriend now and I was awakened by what I thought at first was someone moaning in pain. I then quickly realized it was my mom moaning while having sex with her boyfriend. Hearing something I’d never heard before and still being a virgin, I eagerly listened. As hearing my mom and her boyfriend having sex whenever he stayed over, I started to get a little annoyed, but I also became aroused. I found myself masturbating, but not just due to the sex going on in the next room, but because my mom sounded so damn sexy moaning. When she would have her orgasms she got really loud and vocal. I’ve always known my mom was attractive, but I suddenly started thinking of her in a different way. I felt guilty about jacking off listening to her and her boyfriend having sex, but I also was feeling something else. My mom’s boyfriend never had much to do with me, and I started realizing I wasn’t wild about him having sex with my mom. I came to realize that I actually was jealous of my mom’s boyfriend because he makes her moan loud during sex. It made me uncomfortable around my mom, which she noticed because we get along so well and always are joking around. I didn’t know what to say, but I knew I had to say something. Finally I just told her that I have heard her having sex, honestly it would be impossible not to hear her, and that I didn’t really like hearing it. As my mom sat there I couldn’t tell if she was pissed off, or just how to tell me what a pervert I am. My mom looked at me with just kind of a straight face, and told me that I was just jealous. Then she asked me if I wanted to sleep with her? I was surprised by what she said, but I played along expecting only to be sleeping in the same bed with her. I sleep in just my boxers and my mom only wears a nightgown and panties. I got under the covers and turned on the TV not knowing what to expect. This could even end up being some kind of trick to teach me some kind of a lesson. My mom came into the room a short time later wearing a thin nightgown, I knew she didn’t wear a bra to bed, and I could almost see her breasts through her nightgown, I could even make out the silhouette of her areolas and noticed her nipples were hard, in turn I was getting hard myself. She told me to turn off the TV because she wanted to get to sleep, which made me a little nervous. I was trying to just relax and go to sleep when I felt my mom’s hand on my still semi-erection through my boxers. She started kind of squeezing it a little and kept her hand around my quickly growing erection. Within seconds I was completely hard. My mom took my hand putting it on her breast and told me to feel her breast. I started cupping it in my hand, feeling how round and firm it was and hard her nipple excited me tremendously. Mom pulled my dick out of my boxers and started stroking it. Then she turned toward me and kissed me, but our lips didn’t part, instead I felt her tongue parting my lips and entering my mouth. We were both breathing hard when my mom broke our kiss, pulled off her nightgown, then my boxers and put a leg of hers on both sides of me. Looking down I realized my mom wasn’t wearing any panties as she grabbed my dick and positioned her pussy above it. She told me it was time for me to lose my virginity, and lowered herself down slowly taking my cock inside her until she was sitting on my lap. I felt like bells and whistles where going off in my head as I felt the incredible sensation of being inside my mom’s pussy. Then she started moving up and down my pole and told me to squeeze her tits and play with her nipples. We were both breathing hard, my mom was moaning just like I’d heard her with her boyfriend which really excited me. She rode my pole and quickly was having a loud orgasm, which was good because I was bucking up into her pussy ready to cum myself. I started pumping streams of my cum into my mom. My legs were shaking and my cock was throbbing as I continued shooting sperm into her pussy. Even after my last spurt and my mom stopped, my cock kept throbbing for like five minutes as my mom rested on my pelvis as I remained inside her. We ended up thoroughly enjoying each others bodies last night repeatedly. My mom was gone when I got up, but her boyfriends out of town this weekend, so I’m so hoping for another night like last night. She’ll be home soon so I will know shortly. I feel guilty because she is my mom, but at the same time I am so horny I can barely take it. I’ve already emptied my balls twice today.

Comment.create(content: 'I am exactly the same; I avoid violence and fighting at all costs, I like to care for animals and I like to please people and make everyone happy. But yet all day everyday I am having daydreams about killing people and torturing people, as a teenager I did a lot of research into weapons and poisons and I even collected weapons for a few years. I am also completely obsessed with reading about violent crime and murder, violence and death are a big preoccupation of mine and I am always thinking about it even when I am just walking through the street or when I am in college it is all I think about. I have had these thoughts since I was a child, when I was a kid I always wanted to be a doctor or a detective because I was obsessed with violence and death so much. For years i was concerned that these fantasies and thoughts were a bad sign and that I am destined to be a murderer, but I accepted they will always be a part of me and so i decided to go along with my childhood fantasy and at age 22 I decided that I want to be a forensic pathologist and I am so determined to keep studying so i can make that happen one day. And it’s so cool now I can indulge myself in criminology books and read about people doing all the things I have fantasiesd about and I can speak openly about it and people accept it and encourage it. Maybe there is a way for you to turn your fantasies into something positive? Maybe you could write murder novels or persue a career that focuses on murder/violence? Once you find an outlet for it you won’t feel so worried about thinking about these things all the time and you can just embrace it', secret_id: 210930)

However, love can blind people and I lost sight of it. Recently I’ve seen things in the corners of my room and hear voices. Like I said, I don’t believe in any religion so I can’t say it’s a Demon or anything of the like. A tip for you, stick to what makes you happy.

There is a song by Matchbox 20 that always makes me so glad I never cheated on my husband, it’s called “Back to Good” and its about this very topic–wanting to be with someone else, coming up with ways to justify it (I’m lonely, it’s nothing, it’s normal…) and then at the end the lyrics are “But I’m sorry now, and I don’t know how to get it back to good”.  Sometimes it can never go back to good, it’s a huge risk and not worth it.  🙂', secret_id: 210726)

And here’s some news for you if you’re interested..some of the Catholic Popes had secret homosexual affairs. Ha.Some weren’t too private, almost everyone who was associated with them knew about it. One Pope was having sex with one of his pages also a male of course. Also bisexual liasons were abounding with a couple of the Popes. A few had mistresses and illegitimate children. One Pope had orgies and had turned the place into a brothel but don’t take my word for it, Look it up yourself if you don’t believe me. Anyway,what im trying to say is that the only sin in it is not being true to who you are. If you’re gay, youre gay and there is nothing that the church can do about it except turn you away and shun you and who would want to be affiliated with people who can’t or won’t accept you the way you are because of some silly law or rule of their own making, not the bible’s or God’s or Jesus’s.

Comment.create(content: 'My mother was abusing me from the time I was toddler, and that includes physical emotional mental and yes even sexual abuse. Her motivations for it we’re rather unique and very screwed up but it wasn’t about sex for her and she never made it about pleasure for me. It was actually primarily driven by her compulsive need to both control me and to maintain my passively forced dependency on her.  When puberty hit me that all came to a screeching halt because like a lot of pedophiles they’re only attracted to genuine children or prepubescent kids. When it comes to the physical and sexual parts of that abuse  I was profoundly ignorant  of what was being done and why .  I was simply  expected  to comply with what I was told to do  and to accept what was done to me. As a result of that, I spent about three years in a very lonely isolated and ignorant State of Mind that lasted until I stumbled upon masturbation when I was 15. And I completely owned the fact that once I figured out what masturbation was, I was willingly overcompensating and acting out in a number of inappropriate ways. As that activity went on and increased, there were a few  specific occasions when those act outs we’re right on the edge of or completely crossed the line into dangerous territory. The worst one of all was as close to being an abuser myself as I ever want to be. All that being said, I know what it’s like to be the victim in reality and I know what it’s like to be the abuser in my head. Honestly you don’t strike me as an abuser or a monster, and since it was a one-time thing you don’t strike me as someone do you use that random incident to develop it with your son further. The incident is what it is, and doesn’t sound like anything worse. You should probably let yourself off the hook for it, which I get is easier said than done. If it weighs on you that badly as difficult as it may be, make the time to talk to your son about it.', secret_id: 210664)
Comment.create(content: 'I am the one who posted this comment above. Those rare instances where my act outs were genuinely over the line and dangerous, my mother would periodically insist on masturbating me, apparently as a means to keep me controlled or to stave off the risk of me doing them or worse again.  It wasn’t sensual or loving, it was akwardly and humiliatingly mechanical as she reminded me what a dirty disgusting thing I was and wht she was abusive all along.  It was a hell of a brainwashing job but it worked.  It was simply about trying to keep me from behaving in such ways by keeping my appetite controlled, I guess.  At that point, even though she was perhaps mopping up her own mess of a son that she created, to an abstract degree those shamefully embarassing episodes were keeping the bad behavior at bay.  Point being, there are a number of reasons that far worse could have happened with you, but it sounds like a simple one-off that troubles you more than it should.', secret_id: 210664)

You don’t say how old your son was when you did this but at any age it’s not normal or OK and not something that can be brushed off as a “one-off” as the anonymous person who replied said. That person is admittedly  damaged from being a victim of abuse himself so please don’t take advice from him. It’s good that you haven’t molested your son again but please seek help to figure out why you did it in the first place. Incest is the sickest kind of abuse IMO.', secret_id: 210664)

What’s weird is that I still like the idea of a werewolf, and I LARP and roleplay with werewolf characters, but that doesn’t upset me at all. It’s just the knowledge that I actually thought that at midnight on my fourteenth birthday, I would turn into a wolfish humanoid, and the fact that I told several people that I was a werewolf, that makes me want to tear out my hair.', secret_id: 210572)

Comment.create(content: 'In 2004, a little boy named Jimmy was sleeping in his bed. He then woke up and walked in front of his laundry room and spotted a glass antique doll with blond hair on the laundry room window ledge. He glared at the doll and screamed, “Whore! Slut! The sandwich that never knew bread!” Jimmy immediately regretted his decision as the doll glared at him and jumped off the window ledge.

Raw power and rippling muscles. Hunt whatever you want to and fuck whenever you want to.

It’s been two years, and I cant look at the people I’ve told in the eyes anymore without getting flashbacks that get me into a self-wasting rage. What’s weird is that I still like the idea of a werewolf, and I LARP and roleplay with werewolf characters, but that doesn’t upset me at all.

Not to mention werewolves gang banging a “werepanther,” yeah that’d be doubtful. I doubt Werebeasts go in heat, and if they do it makes no sense. Animals go into heat to have offspring, us humans don’t due to the fact that we can have children after puberty (speaking technically) however it’d be best to wait till you’re in your mid 20s. Heat for a Werepather is ridiculous, bugger off with your bullshit', secret_id: 210313)

Then when i lost most of my feelings for him and my sex drive because he ruined it for me everytime we got together then he wanted it. Like wtf dude. I can’t tell you what to do that’s your choice obviously,  but personally, i would kick his ass out of my life if it were me. He put me through so much bullshit for almost 4 years and for what? Because he wasn’t attracted to me? even tho he said he was idk. He lied about a lot of things too. So life’s too short to put up with that kind of stuff.', secret_id: 210311)

This is NOT the first time. : Smollett pleaded no contest in 2007 in Los Angeles to charges of DUI, driving without a license and providing false information to police. Smollett identified himself as his younger brother, actor and celebrity chef Jake Smollett, after being pulled over and wrote his brother’s name on the promise to appear in court.  He was sentenced to two years probation and a choice of a fine or jail in the 2007 case. : This gives a clearer picture of Smollett’s character.

Not to mention Africa has a Rape culture. Stop kidding yourself with that crap. 2) I’ll assume you mean cops killing blacks, and more than twice the number of white people are killed by cops. 3) people probably say that blacks have aids because of how prevalent they are in Africa, because the culture they have. People in Africa believe myths such as “if you have sex with a virgin you’ll be cleansed of aids.” Which clearly doesn’t work, but it still goes on. . Not to mention African men rape babies. Let that one sink in to your brain. It is a truth. South Africa for example, it’s the best country in Africa, but it’s got the problems I’ve said above. South Africa is a failed place, and many other African countries are as well. Drugs run rampant, violence lines most of those countries, and the death toll is insanely high. As for the “BBC” mention at the end, its pointless. The fact that you have a bigger cock on average to white men, means nothing.  That’s like saying because my hands are bigger I’m superior. It’s funny you titled that “Dear Racists,” when you’re clearly a racist. And don’t throw that “minorities can’t be racist” dog shit.

Literally what you should be doing for yourself is making your own self happy and loving yourself. You may think you are ugly, but it’s far from the truth. Be happy in your own skin and be beautiful in your own way. I thought I was ugly when I was around your age and eventually I’ve grown to love myself because I was beautiful in my own, unique way. Second thing, even if I gotten better looking boys do not mature as quickly as us ladies just fyi. Guys age about 7 years behind girls. And especially if you make a boy more important than your own happiness, you are spelling trouble for yourself. You can love him, but remember who is more important in this relationship: your happiness. Self love child.', secret_id: 209735)

I don’t doubt that you’re depressed and that you have a good reason to be depressed but the best way to overcome this kind of situation is to keep pushing because honestly, this doesn’t sound like something you can’t turn around. | Some things to consider: 1. Social Security isn’t going away anytime soon ( I’m assuming you live in the United States). Both the Republican and Democratic party fully support our social security system and there’s no sign of that changing, even if there’s a few Trump fanatics who say otherwise (and when I say fanatics I’m talking about people who think he’s the devil AND people who think he’s god lol) | 2. Do you have your AA degree? Even if you can’t get to your Bachelors there’s still a lot of job options with a 2-year degree. Hell, even if you don’t have an AA there’s still retail work and government jobs ( The Post Office is the best example I can think of for someone in your age range). I know retail doesn’t seem that glamorous but hey, you work long and hard enough it’s really not that hard to get a managerial position and make a decent independent living for yourself. | 3. This is a morbid tip but you could just leave your Mom’s house if ya’ll really don’t get along. If you’re feeling insecure about your clothes I would just shoplift some dresses from Walmart or Target or something. Take showers at a local GYM or Recreation Center. I was homeless (living in my car ) for 6 months when I was a kid and my classmates never even noticed so I can say from experience that those tricks work. | 4. (Last one I swear) 37 isn’t that old, you’re technically not even middle-aged yet (The average life expectancy for humans is hitting the 80’s). You’ve got ample time to turn shit around. Keep studying, cheat in class if you have to, get that A by any means necessary.

Clean and stuff even when she doesn’t ask you. When she says something demeaning or overly critical just take it in and don’t let it bother you. Don’t let anything she says bother you. Instead, make your coexistence a top priority. Show that your useful by contributing to the household so that no one has an excuse to bother you, that way you can always silently comfort yourself when they talk shit about you. “What’s that mom? I’m a lazy fag? Well, this lazy fag is the reason we have electricity in this god damn house”. Get to a point where you can say something like that. Plus as your mom gets older and her health beings the fail, I’m sure she’ll begin to see why she should be kinder to, and be able to rely on, you. | 7.

Verse 2 And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? Verse 3 Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned,  nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.', secret_id: 209603)
Comment.create(content: ' This man who was born from his mother’s womb was born blind. The disciples asked Jesus who sinned, this man or his parents that he was born blind? How could a sin have occurred that this man committed that caused him to be born blind? Unless we’re talking about what? Reincarnation and karma. There are two things right there. Karma: he was born blind and reincarnation: his sin in a previous life caused this blindness to occur at his birth. These are the disciples of Jesus Christ. These are the guys that Jesus Christ is teaching and they are asking questions. Hey you’re the one who’s teaching. This guy’s born blind, did he sin to cause this? Omg like Buddha?!? Where did he get this stuff from? Anyway,when Jesus answered, did he say, wait a minute here how could a man sin before he’s born? He didn’t ask that question. He didn’t say it’s impossible. He didn’t say it’s nonsense. What does he say? He says neither this man sinned (nor his parents) he’s saying no,  this is not a karmic situation in this case. It was not something this man did in a previous lifetime that caused it. This passage deals with previous existences of sinning before birth. John 9:6 When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. In the East, to spit is a symbol of contempt. People are going to say that Jesus spat on the ground in order to make mud to put on the guy’s eyes. He didn’t have to go through this kind of stuff. If he wanted to go on and say you’re healed, he could have just said, you’re healed. Why did he spit on the ground? The ground comes out of the word Adam which is earth which is symbolic of the carnal mind. What Jesus did was make a statement. What made this man blind from birth is the carnal mind and God spits on it in contempt. That’s God’s enemy. So he spits upon that which is the earth. Now what does he do? He made clay of the spittle. He took the earth and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. In other words, he is taking and saying these are the fears and the hurts and the guilt of the lower mind upon which i have spat with contempt. He places them over the man’s eyes and he says, this is what has caused you to be blind. This is why you can’t see. This is why you’re not enlightened. This is why you’re not aware of who you really are. This is why you’re not aware of your kingship, of your sonship, your Christ consciousness because of that which is your lower mind. And so he takes this and he puts this on the man’s eyes and he says in Verse 7  Go wash in the pool of Si-lo’am (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He sent him. The man went there which is the place of peace, submerges himself into that which is God’s truth and that clay which is the lower mind falls from from his eyes and he can see. It’s a form of Spiritual Baptism.', secret_id: 209603)

I have seen people in hospital corridors praying frantically for the lives of their children to be saved and even though there is a large part of me that thought that those prayers are meaningless- there was a part of me that had to confess that I noticed strenght in those prayers.

We then laid there and held each other under the covers all night. I told her just how much I was in love with her.  Really, I have never loved a woman like I love her.  we did make love one more time before she went home. It was magical. Our first time was everything I wanted it to be.

Comment.create(content: ' The Slacker. This employee is a master at procrastination, passing responsibilities to someone else, and making excuses for why they can’t complete their work. The Bully. This employee is overly aggressive with their co-workers and uses their position or intimidating personality to achieve desired results. Workplace bullying is on the rise. Some 25-50 percent of workers report being bullied at work at some point in their careers, and the consequences are severe. They include lost productivity, increased turnover, brand and reputation damage, and legal costs. The Gossip. This person clearly has not moved on from high school and college. They relish in creating drama through rumor-spreading and like to be in everyone’s business. The Lone Wolf. “That’s not my job.” “I can do this myself.” This employee is the antithesis of a team player. They often present unique challenges because they are usually very high performers. A client has a rock star sales performer who doesn’t fit into the culture and prefers to do things their way, but they are crushing their sales quota. We are applying different strategies to leverage their strength and minimize their negative impact, including a re-organization. The Emotional Mess. I often advise my clients to remember that every hire brings emotional baggage. This is why it’s crucial to closely screen for how candidates manage stressful situations. Employees who use their work environment as a therapist’s office are disruptive, even if they aren’t malicious. The Closed-Minded Know-It-All. When I help my clients screen for their new hires, I ask questions to help me determine if the candidates have mindsets of learning and curiosity.

Why continue to obsess over the impossible, take harmful hormones & undergo risky procedures to “look” like a boy? The doctors benefit & you dont. In the end you are still not a boy. I dont understand this push instant to make ppl change. Isnt it more logical to just at least try therapy to accept yourself? Any type of surgery will only be aesthetic anyway.. & while you may eventually appear to be male from the publics perception, you yourself would STILL know the truth & morally obligated to inform your love interest of what you are, not male. So how is it possible anything would changed for you? Sounds remedial as fuck. Doctors are preting on you ppl & pushing you have procedure to fix you when theoretically, therapy to accept your true self & have real happiness may just work. But no one wants to go that route for some very odd reason.', secret_id: 208770)

It was usually always in the middle of the night (whenever he woke up horny, I guess), always in silence, and we never spoke of it.  This went on for several years and I have to admit after I hit puberty and become orgasming from the anal fucking, I quite enjoyed it.  Then one day at a cousin’s house, he told me my brother revealed that I loved getting fucked in the ass and he wanted to do it to me as well.  Humiliating – by then I understood the stigma of being gay, but felt trapped, so I also let him fuck me.  It became a very open dirty family secret and I was often put into a position to allow several cousins to fuck me at will.  After I moved away from my family I managed to come to terms with being gay, and I often fantasize about being that young, 10-12 or so, and being fucked by them.

If you don’t I would get checked out by a gyn oncologist and a reproductive endocrinologist. And get a dietician to help you lose weight, please for your own sake do it. You do not want to get cancers, chronic pain, heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, high blood pressure. Please don’t be an idiot like I was.', secret_id: 207824)

Neither gender identity nor sexual orientation should be the leading or primary facets of personality or how someone presents themselves to others.  Now, that being said, I am someone who has ALWAYS known all my fundamental thought processes and behaviors have been those stereotypically considered female, and I am physically male.  The tendency to lead with gender identity or sexual orientation is often driven by the frustrations and pain of being told or forced to bottle up all of it and act “normal”, and no one can bottle it up all the time, by the people who tell us to act “normal” or conform to expectations.  LBGTQ people are often genuinely obnoxious about it…and I am one of them, saying that.

Because I am an art student at one of the best art colleges in Canada, my parents really want me to stick with school. However, it’s also important to live your own life, and not try to fix things by yourself all the time. You should be set free, and live your own life. Accept things as the way they are and move on.

Red costume, torn off to expose a tiny, red, torn bikini, jet-red, long nails, heels, made-up, and very sexy. She gave me a look and cute little wave during her initial dance, made her rounds, then really got into it. The real show started. Top flies off, showing off her firm, round, pretty much perfect tits, then, the bottoms. That became leg-spreading (in front of my face..with a wide smile on her face), using props, and driving the guys crazy. The topper was shooting a small, round candle out of her hole, then lighting it onstage. Was wild and had me UP for her.', secret_id: 207102)

Comment.create(content: 'After beating cancer, I’ve learned a lot of things about life. Now, it really, really takes something big to make me angry. I basically refuse to get angry, period. And that really irritates some people. To hell with them. For each minute I’m angry, that’s 60 seconds of happiness or peace I lost. Here is my new adage: if whatever you’re angry over isn’t going to matter in one year, just let it go. Don’t be bothered by what others say to you. If they say, “fuck you, you asshole!” Just walk on, smile and yell at them to have a nice day! Love is really all that matters. I’d rather spend an hour hugging and kissing my son and daughter than writing letters and answering phones for 15.00 and hour at a secretary job. Most of what we do on Earth is pointless. Just love, cuddle, smile, give, be kind, have sex, don’t talk about or report people for their mistakes, have mercy, meditate, have fun and do wjat makes YOU happy.', secret_id: 207056)

If we could find enough people who loved everyone from the bottom of their hearts despite what these men did, and it would have to be very special people to work with these men, because over the years I found out it is much easier for people to hate and be unforgiving, we could have a lot of ex prisoners thriving in this world instead of the current state where they get out, experience homelessness, despair, hatred, and are back in prison. Instead, I see these men as capable of needing help and guidance for a while but then becoming homeowners, college graduates, business owners, husbands, loving fathers, and mentors to other men who are going through what they went thrpugh.

You want to cum so bad it hurts some times.  You may even start thinking about settling for a BJ from another guy even know you are not into them.  Something is on the inside eating at you trying to get out.  Usually at this point when I start getting hard and it is warm, I have to go somewhere and jack off.  Usually after I cum, I kinda feel dirty and guilty, but usually after a while, I feel ok.  I am a sex addict and I feel like this on a daily basis most days.  I can go JO and be ok for an hour or so, then all I think about is sex.  When I see or talk to a woman, her vagina is all I am thinking about.  With exceptions of course.  Not into family, minors, or old grannies or anything gross like that, but all other women are fair game.  I hope this answers your question.

One is what guys want to see in sex slaves. Beautiful is how all of the amazing systems in your body know how to work together to keep you alive, and to let you experience joy, and sadness. Even pain. All different emotions and feelings. You’re able to love and able to hate. Able to smell a scent and think of home. That’s true beauty. But nowadays it’s all about how attractive you look. I stick to being me. I like me. I don’t wear makeup, and I wear hoodies and jeans and sneakers rather than pink and Calvin Klein crop tops and tight yoga pants or whatever.', secret_id: 206916)

Comment.create(content: 'Why don’t you intervene on his behalf? If his mother is causing his behavior, why don’t you take your stepson out for a day of fun? Do what he wants to do…fishing, biking, going to a carnival, etc. Why don’t you get to know him while no one else is around? Ask him what’s on his mind? In life, I have learned if a child misbehaves there is likely a cause- they’re stressed, they are being put down or ignored. Does anyone in the family make fun of him or berate him? Do something just for him that mzkes him feel special or proud about himself. You have an opportunity to perhaps guide this young man and make his life better. Maybe you are, unconciously, making him feel like a second class citizen to your own children? I.e. do you treat your own children better than him? Try to get to know him, praise him when he deserves it, encourage him. He’s probably been through a lot and maybe he feels you just want to abandon him too. Maybe he’s been abandoned or shown he’s not wanted (I wish she would take him out of state, etc.). I bet if you truly invest in him, show him he’s loved unconditionally, and show him he’s safe from abandonment ( maybe that is why he acts out- he’s afraid to love anyone for fear they will leave him), and his behavior would improve. Love him and be a father figure to him, treat him just like you would a biological child, never call him names or put him down. He needs someone right now. Be the difference in his life.', secret_id: 206746)
Comment.create(content: 'I am his step mother and he is 2. He will yell NO at me if I so much as glance at him regardless of all of the things I do for him. I try to play with him and do fun things with him but he has hit and pushed me and glares at me often. I treat him no different than my own children and that is part of the ‘issue’. When he has visitation with his mother he is an only child and allowed to do everything he wants with no discipline or consequences and throws end of the world tantrums at my house when he gets in trouble and has to sit in time out. He is mean to me and my children and I can’t take it… He’s going to have a little sister soon and I’m so  about him being mean to the baby because he is extremely jealous of any one else getting his fathers attention, so much so he has screamed at my children when his father plays with them. He is a spoiled brat toddler in my opinion :/', secret_id: 206746)
Comment.create(content: 'Maybe find a child psychologist? Is his mom physically abusing him? Maybe he should have less contact with her or none at all. Now, I know 2 year olds can completely get on your nerves, but you sound like a great mother. I think things will get better in time, a lot of adjustment has happened in his short life. Here is a suggestion for you to start bonding with him. At his bedtime, after his bath, cuddle up with him in a recliner or something as he is getting sleepy. Sing to him, read him books, rub his back. Stuff that will make him feel relaxed and safe. He will start to trust you and not see you as an enemy. Be consistent with this- it will show him how to calm down and be peaceful which is especially important with a new baby coming. Best wishes to you and your beautiful family.', secret_id: 206746)

If God says the stars are for signs, don’t you think we should find out what the signs are? And if God has named them, don’t you think we should find out why He called them what he has? Let’s skip ahead to Luke vers 10 where it says “And he said unto them, (this is Jesus speaking) Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in.” This couldn’t be a literal man with a pitcher of water due to the fact that back in those days,a man wouldn’t be caught dead carrying a pitcher of water. The man with the pitcher of water is none other than Aquarius. The constellation. (remember the song by The Fifth Dimension? Im sure some of you oldsters do haha) so this is a direct prophecy of the times we are living in now and when we understand that we are living in the Aquarian Age, we fulfill the prophecy by entering into the house. People all over the globe are waking up! Jesus Christ said that those of you who are within these things are given to know the mysteries and to those who are without all these things are done in parables.', secret_id: 206300)

Comment.create(content: 'I spot problems with this… “truth.” . “Men rule and control everything” Handsome and rich men, yes. As someone else stated many men are below women. Which is the truth. Not to mention, things are this day because for most of our existence (The Human Race) men were seen as superior to women in many ways. Such as strength. Strength was needed for ages for survival, now it’s not needed as much. . “The reality is that men can buy/rent our bodies anytime of the friggin day that they please for sex!” Women could do the same for men, there’s probably male prostitutes and brothels for women somewhere. Not to mention, the vast majority of women could get a man for a one night stand or just for sex with ease. . “Also, they can rape us if they really want to! We are powerless in that area and that’s the truth!” There are a few mistakes here. Msn can also be raped by women, and have. Most don’t report it though because they’ll be seen as not a man or cowardly. Or because they feel it’ll being shame to them. Majority of places see men hitting a woman as illegal or it’s heavily frowned upon. Powerless, no you’re not. As the person above has said, many women learn martial arts. If anything men are powerless when a woman rapes them. Not to mention the number of false rape accusations that ruins the lives of many men.

What if the dog barks too much? What if they pee on your rug? So on and so forth. Would you just get annoyed and get through it or would you harm the dog? Do not answer, because no one knows the truth. My rage is at your past and the uncertainty of your future. I can’t be kind to you, I just can’t. Because I do not know if you are truly harmless.

I screwed up” would have been enough. I never even reported him when I caught him in that lie. He could have lost his job, all the years he’s spent helping people and building his life.

They continue to do these bad things because they think no one loves, likes, or respects them so why should they even change? People can and do change but it is much easier for them to change when they are loved and treated with respect. Like that animal abuser as a child/teenager. She said she changed her ways. What if you call her a freak made her feel depressed again and she went out and hurt more animals as a way to try and relieve her depression that you caused? You should apologize to her and congratulate her on changing her ways. Praise makes people want to continue doing good, ridicule doesn’t work. It never has.

Comment.create(content: 'Can I tell you something? (Yes, I am the animal abuser). I have been a horrible person. You may hate me for this, but I even mocked my own mother for being a rape victim. She was raped when she was 15 along with her sister who was 17. I called my own mom stupid essentially for following her sister into a car with strange men. I told my mom, because of how mean she was with me, that she deserved to lose her first 4 children (they all miscarried). My mom made fun of me for feeling embarassment when CPS removed me from her home. A social worker made me lie and say a neighbor molested me when he never touched me. Long story short, I came to terms with the fact that I am a horrible human being. But I dedicated myself to turning my life around. I made a vow to be more forgiving to everyone, to love more, to be kind. Yes, I hated myself for years. But two years ago, when I was diagnosed with an aggressive form or pre-cancer, it woke me up. I don’t hate myself anymore. I don’t hate others anymore. I will never be abusive again. I will forgive. I will smile. I will always, always, always be kind. God gave me a second chance at life when I got rid of the precancer due to medicine and weight loss (nearly 100 pounds!).  and I will use it to the fullest. I just wish people would give me that second chance, too. I don’t want to be constantly reminded of everything bad I did. I want to grow.', secret_id: 206134)

Their Papa Pope has insignia and symbols of sun gods all over their vestments, robes, churches and the vatican. Their hats they use in some of their ceremonies can be traced back to the worship of the fish god, Dagon. They’re either ignorant and just showing off or they are keeping a life or death secret and they’re not revealing anything to their faithful followers about any of it. They teach doctrines of men as the doctrines of God. Jesus condemned religion in the bible and i personally cannot wait until they fall flat on their smug, secretive, evil faces. And what is that gorgoyle looking thing behind the Pope’s throne? And why does he get a throne? And all the money they rake in every single god damn day? They’re stinking wealthy and don’t have to work for nothing and get to tour around the world every so often. Have you put money in their collection plate lately? You’re a bunch of suckers and they’re laughing all the way to the fucking bank! And they can’t make up their minds on whether homosexuality is a sin or not  and eunuchs are mentioned in the bible. Effeminate men is what eunuchs are and it says in the bible they are that way from birth. There are homosexual people, GAY from the time they were born, all over the world and your repulsion and your hate is not going to stop it! The Catholics are ignorant and their leaders have said their followers are too dumb to understand the bible so they shouldn’t read it. Yeah, let’s just allow their priests to interpret the bible for us so we don’t have to think for ourselves! I could go on and on and on but what’s the point? You wouldn’t do the research yourself anyway because you’re too busy fornicating, skirt chasing, eating snatch sucking dick or fantisizing about those things on these websites and making stupid confessions about how the Catholic religion is the only true religion.', secret_id: 206045)
